from defendant to defender one wrongfully convicted man frees another attorney jarrett adams recently helped overturn an innocent man s conviction in the same state that years ago had sentenced him to prison for a crime he did not commit the case was adams first professional win but it was also deeply personal for the year old who spent nearly years behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of sexual assault in a case that adams who is black believes was tainted by racism this is a storybook adams told nbc news lester holt it s a storybook tale that you wouldn t believe until you saw it to have a conviction overturned and in a court in a state that i was wrongfully convicted adams was only when an encounter at a party an accusation and a court appointed attorney put his life on hold he had just finished high school on chicago s south side and decided to go to the university of wisconsin for a party where he and his friends met a young woman and had what he describes as a completely consensual encounter from beginning to end three weeks later as adams was getting ready to start junior college in the fall of he was arrested an officer informed him that the woman said she was raped and that he was being charged with a group sexual assault along with two other teenagers adams had never been arrested before he denied the crime from the start and thought the misunderstanding would get resolved quickly instead he was extradited to wisconsin where he couldn t afford legal assistance a court appointed attorney chose not to put on a defense even though there was a witness who could have helped clear adams a student living in the dorm who could corroborate adams timeline of events jarrett adams courtesy of jarrett adams this guy is telling us we know you didn t do it they haven t proven their case the best defense is a no defense strategy adams said we re like yeah sounds good because we didn t know any better right but in reality it was a horrible idea to not call any witnesses not to investigate and to put this in front of an all white racially charged jury we didn t stand a chance the result was a conviction with a stunning year prison sentence for adams years for another teen who couldn t pay for representation and an acquittal for the third who had hired a private lawyer and called the alibi witness my only encounter with the criminal court system was law order and at the end of those commercials and that theme music comes on you don t see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to years adams said inside prison adams met a cellmate who worked for the prison law library and encouraged him to try to get his conviction overturned my only encounter with the criminal court system was law order and at the end of those commercials and that theme music comes on you don t see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to years he said listen i go over hundreds of inmates cases and all of them say the same thing i m innocent he said i ve never seen a case like yours before you re in here for some racist bull crap and you ve essentially waved the white flag adams said the cellmate urged him not to give up it s only going to take a second before you have tattoos on your face and have given up and completely don t care at all you need to go down swinging he told adams so adams started reading law books and found a supreme court case that stated that the constitution required defendants be provided effective assistance of counsel he got in touch with attorney keith findley with the wisconsin innocence project a state chapter of the nonprofit devoted to justice for wrongfully convicted people findley knew the case was an uphill battle but he took it on he had done his homework he knew the case factually better than anybody and he knew the law so that he was engaging with us discussing legal issues strategy findley said adams sentence was eventually overturned and the charges dropped for the exact reason that he had found in the prison law library books ineffective assistance of counsel a month after he was freed in adams enrolled in community college went on to earn his bachelor s degree and attended law school graduating in last summer he became the first innocence project exonoree to be hired as an attorney by the organization what i wanted more than anything was this i wanted my mother when she went to church and people asked about her son for her not to duck her head in her bible and cry and i wanted her to be proud he said recently adams found himself back in a wisconsin courtroom this time working side by side with his former attorney findley to free another man they believed was wrongfully convicted richard beranek was convicted of rape in although he had alibi witnesses that put him in another state at the time of the rape the jury found the testimony of an fbi expert tying him to the scene through a microscopic hair analysis convincing enough to deliver a guilty verdict adams who served time in the same correctional facility as his client was dedicated to freeing him findley said i can talk to richard about what i ve seen other exonerees go through what the experience looks like from the outside but i couldn t do what jarrett can do i couldn t speak with the authenticity of knowing what it feels like that jarrett can speak to findley said in june a dane county circuit judge overturned beranek s conviction citing dna evidence that proves the fbi hair analysis was wrong beranek is now a free man in large part thanks to adams tireless work nothing pays me back more or my family than me walking in the same court in the same state where they didn t even look at me when they gave me years adams said but now they have to acknowledge me as attorney adams,pos
amazon tribe wins lawsuit against big oil saving millions of acres of rainforest the amazon rainforest is well known across the world for being the largest and most dense area of woodland in the world spanning across nine countries the amazon is home to millions of different animal and plant species as well as harboring some for the world s last remaining indigenous groups the waorani people of pastaza are an indigenous tribe from the ecuadorian amazon and have lived in the rainforest for many generations however there home came under threat from a large oil company they didn t take it lightly legal win after a long legal battle with a number of organizations the waorani people successfully protected half a million acres of their ancestral territory in the amazon rainforest from being mined for oil drilling by huge oil corporations the auctioning off of waorani lands to the oil companies was suspended indefinitely by a three judge panel of the pastaza provincial court the panel simply trashed the consultation process the ecuadorian government had undertaken with the tribe in which rendered the attempt at land purchase null and void this win for the indigenous tribe has now set an invaluable legal precedent for other indigenous nations across the ecuadorian amazon after accepting a waorani bid for court protection to stop an oil bidding process the court also halted the potential auctioning off of oil blocks that cover over million acres of indigenous territory government corruption while there is no evidence some people believe that the ecuadorian government may be accepting bribes in some roundabout way the land in question is meant to be protected under ecuador s constitution that establishes the inalienable unseizable and indivisible rights of indigenous people to maintain possession of their ancestral lands and obtain their free adjudication furthermore the constitution also states that there is a need for prior consultation on any plans to exploit the underground resources given the probable environmental and cultural impacts on tribal communities the government claim they did do this in however the tribe alleges that the agreement they came to was based upon fraudulent practices in favor of the oil companies and the government was favoring their bottom line over the people the actually still live on this valuable land due to this the judges ordered the ecuadorian government to conduct a new consultation applying standards set by the inter american court of human rights before anything else is agreed regarding the exploitation of the natural resources below the ground nemonte nenquimo president of the waorani pastaza organization and plaintiff in the lawsuit remarked the government tried to sell our lands to the oil companies without our permission our rainforest is our life we decide what happens in our lands we will never sell our rainforest to the oil companies today the courts recognized that the waorani people and all indigenous peoples have rights over our territories that must be respected the government s interests in oil is not more valuable than our rights our forests our lives this is a major win for indigenous tribes all over the ecuadorian amazon rainforest and even perhaps the amazon as a whole this has definitely set a new precedent regarding indigenous peoples rights over the land they live in and offers them a glimmer of hope in protecting their cultural heritage they ll definitely need plenty of support in the coming years as economical advances such as this one will keep coming more and more as the world becomes ever growingly desperate for the natural resources that the beautiful land holds,pos

a mysterious grey hat is patching people s outdated mikrotik routers botnet beast how to slay the ddos dragon watch now a russian speaking grey hat hacker is breaking into people s mikrotik routers and patching devices so they can t be abused by cryptojackers botnet herders or other cyber criminals zdnet has learned the hacker who goes by the name of alexey and says he works as a server administrator claims to have disinfected over mikrotik routers already alexey has not been trying to hide his actions and has boasted about his hobby on a russian blogging platform he says he accesses routers and makes changes to their settings to prevent further abuse also best vpn services of safe and fast don t come for free i added firewall rules that blocked access to the router from outside the local network alexey said in the comments i wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the router os telegram channel where it was possible for them to ask questions but despite adjusting firewall settings for over users alexey says that only users reached out via telegram a few said thanks but most were outraged the vigilante server administrator says he s been only fixing routers that have not been patched by their owners against a mikrotik vulnerability that came to light in late april at the time the vulnerability known as cve was a zero day but mikrotik rolled out a fix in record time nonetheless cyber criminals quickly jumped on board to exploit the flaw cve is a very convenient vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and download the user database file attackers decrypt this file and then use one of the username password combos to log into a remote device and make os settings and run various scripts for the past five and a half months the vulnerability has been mainly used to plant cryptojacking scripts on outdated mikrotik routers and to hijack dns servers and later redirect user traffic towards malicious sites this wouldn t be an issue but mikrotik is one of today s most popular router brand there are over two million mikrotik routers around the globe security researcher troy mursch told zdnet today that of the millions of mikrotik routers currently connected to the internet over show signs they ve been infected with cryptocurrency mining scripts speaking to zdnet today ankit anubhav a security researcher for newsky security has also indicated that ddos botnet authors have also been trying to infect and corral these devices under their control but failing the usual iot blackhat botnet factory is basically clueless about the exploit and how it can be deployed for a proper functioning botnet anubhav said instead he says the people placing cryptocurrency mining scripts on the devices are far more adept at hijacking the vulnerable routers anubhav speculated that this looks to be the work of a knowledgeable lone actor things became even worse for the mikrotik community this past week after tenable researchers released a new exploit named by the way for the original cve vulnerability this spurred new interest from the botnet community but the reason why alexey was able to clean over routers is because none of the hacker groups currently abusing mikrotik routers appear to perform basic hygiene the attackers are not closing device ports or patching the devices so anyone who wants to further mess with these routers can anubhav told zdnet fortunately alexey has been doing this clean up on some users s behalf but technically speaking alexey is on the wrong side of the law despite his good intentions it is illegal to access another person or organization s equipment without consent alexey s vigilante spree may be illegal but he is definitely not the first in a hacker accessed thousands of asus routers and planted text warnings inside computers with shared folders and hard drives that were located behind those routers warning users to patch their asus device in late a team of vigilante hackers going by the name of the white team launched the linux wifatch malware that closed security holes on a variety of linux based routers at one point the white team s botnet became so big it battled with the botnet of the infamous lizard squad team for the title of the internet s largest botnet in a more devious vigilante hacker named the janit r deployed the brickerbot malware that erased firmware or bricked iot devices that had not been updated also in a hacker made over printers spew out a message to their owners to raise everyone s awareness about the danger of leaving printers exposed online in another vigilante renamed tens of thousands of mikrotik and ubiquiti routers to hacked and other messages to get owners attention to update their devices mursch told zdnet that he doesn t believe the mikrotik situation will get better any time soon rebooting grandma s router won t fix this he said remediation efforts must be done by the service providers the reason is that many of these devices are not routers placed inside users homes but are so called edge devices often part of an isp s internal infrastructure such as routers placed in isp boxes left inside apartment complexes or on street poles another source in the infosec community who spoke to zdnet but did not want his name shared for this story confirmed that alexey s vigilante efforts have also touched edge routers not only those found in people s homes ironically by cleaning some isp routers he might get the isps to act and fix everyone s routers as well the unnamed researcher told us as for mikrotik the latvian company has been one of the most responsive vendors in terms of security flaws fixing issues within hours or days compared to the months that some other router vendors tend to take it would be unfair to blame this situation on them patches have been available for months but yet again it is isps and home users who are failing to take advantage of them

colorado governor to mass pardon plus marijuana convictions colorado gov jared polis plans to mass pardon convictions of low level marijuana possession through an executive order thursday after signing a bill earlier this year that gave him that authority this really catches coloradans up with where the law is today he told the denver post house bill passed by the general assembly earlier this year included a provision that allows the governor to pardon those who have convictions on their criminal records for possessing up to ounces of marijuana the current legal limit for medical marijuana users polis pardon however will only apply to convictions in state courts through of up to ounce for recreational use consistent with colorado amendment passed by voters in it will not apply to convictions in municipal courts or in other states the governor said his office worked with the colorado bureau of investigation to sort through criminal histories and determine the exact number of eligible convictions the total number of individuals who will benefit from the pardon was not immediately available because a single person could have been convicted on more than one charge unlike programs in denver and boulder to expunge marijuana convictions those eligible for the pardon will not have to apply in the first six months of denver s program fewer than of the people eligible successfully got their convictions erased other states have taken action to address previous low level convictions after marijuana legalization nevada for instance automatically pardoned more than and california has adopted an automatic expungement process for certain marijuana convictions minor marijuana offenses could stand in the way of people obtaining jobs student loans or concealed carry permits polis said in addition to being symbolic the pardon has real life ramifications for people he said anyone who wants to check if polis pardon will apply to them can go to comarijuanapardons com the pardon won t expunge or seal records related to the convictions according to the governor s office but the convictions will be removed from individuals public records so if a member of the public runs a background check a conviction won t show up it would still appear in law enforcement background checks but with a note about the governor s pardon that s the next goal for rep james coleman a denver democrat and one of the sponsors of house bill whether it s one or a thousand people my focus is to figure out by the time i m done in the legislature how we not only pardon these individuals but figure out how to expunge it off their records coleman said he plans to look at more policies in the legislative session to address equity and opportunities for people to work in the cannabis industry,pos
high school student nicknamed trash girl by bullies refuses to stop collecting litter many people may not want to think about our plastic pollution problem but it s imperative that we do every year we produce million tons of plastic and around million tons of it get dumped in the oceans threatening countless animals many of which are on the verge of extinction as a result if that wasn t bad enough it s now estimated that by there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish as one of the greatest threats to our oceans and the animals that we share the planet with we need to rethink every single aspect of how much waste we produce and how we deal with it that s why year old nadia sparkes decided to take matters into her own hands the high schooler has been picking up trash along the two mile route from her school to her home for months now using the basket of her bike to bring the trash home in just the short amount of time that she has been picking up trash nadia has already accumulated more than two recycling bins worth of plastic advertisement despite her green intentions some of the kids at nadia s school have dubbed her trash girl and have bullied her for her noble efforts to help the planet it would be easy to succumb to mean comments and stop picking up trash but on the contrary nadia is more determined than ever to clean up her community i m doing something to protect the world they also live in it s everyone s job we are all responsible for keeping this world safe instead of believing that it s always someone else s job nadia said about the bullies i told her she had two choices she could either stop collecting rubbish stop drawing their attention and hopefully they would leave her alone or she could own trash girl paula sparkes nadia s mom said about the bullies as a result of the media attention nadia has received she now has created a facebook group aptly named team trash girl where she shares updates on her efforts positive comments have poured in all in support of nadia advocating for her to ignore the negative nadia i think you re truly awesome own that nickname and don t give up the bullies are ignorant and should be ashamed i wish more people were just like you emma whitmore said advertisement local artists have also shown their support by creating original artwork that boldly says team trash girl if you d like to stay up to date on nadia s work to rid her community of trash you can join the team trash girl facebook group at a time when our plastic pollution has become a full blown environmental crisis nadia s efforts are important now more than ever we need more people like nadia to proudly stand up for what they believe in advertisement what you can do a staggering trillion plastic bags are used each year worldwide according to the earth policy institute plastic bags are made out of non renewable resources like petroleum and natural gas and because they take hundreds of years to decompose when plastics do eventually degrade they don t biodegrade instead they photodegrade which means they break down into smaller fragments and easily soak up toxins which then contaminate waterways soil and animals upon digestion of the plastic materials if we all make an effort to identify where we use plastic and actively look for alternatives we can drastically cut down on the amount of plastic pollution that finds its way into the oceans achieving a percent waste free lifestyle is challenging but it is certainly not impossible just take a look at lauren singer the year old who can store all the waste she s produced in the past few years in just a single mason jar advertisement as the leading organization at the forefront of the conscious consumerism movement one green planet believes that reducing everyday plastics from our lives is not about giving up anything or sacrificing convenience but rather learning to reap the maximum benefits from the items you use every day while having minimal impact if you re ready to start check out one green planet s crushplastic campaign lead image source team trash girl facebook,pos

rising from the rubble london pub rebuilt brick by brick after illegal bulldozing standing next to the rubble of the carlton tavern its patrons thought that this was just another brazen example of developers skirting the law to turn their pub into profit bulldozers had sheared away the wall of the s west london pub with its distinctive tiled signage to reveal the fully stocked bar and darts trophies still on display but the carlton s story did not follow the usual plot where the developer presents the fait accompli to the local authority and pays a fine before pressing ahead with the redevelopment and counting their profits instead after a dogged six year campaign by locals the carlton tavern will reopen next month lockdown permitting after the developers were ordered to rebuild the pub brick by brick a ruling that pub campaigners say has set an extraordinary precedent people said it was impossible said polly robertson a leading member of the rebuild the carlton tavern campaign many people said polly it s not worth it nothing s going to happen and i just thought no i m not going to let it lie the reopening comes on april the day that covid restrictions are due to be lifted in england to let pubs and restaurants serve drinks and meals outdoors it is a day that will be celebrated by england s pubs but by none more keenly than at the carlton in maida vale the carlton tavern s last orders were in april after being denied planning permission to convert it into flats and two days before historic england was due to recommend the pub be granted grade ii listed status the owners ordered its demolition the partially demolished carlton tavern in late april when the local campaign to have it restored began photograph paul davey alamy robertson and other locals including several local councillors mobilised to persuade westminster council to act it ordered the owners ctlx to rebuild the carlton brick by brick a planning inquiry the following year confirmed the decision ruling that the pub should be rebuilt in facsimile from the red bricks to the distinctive tiled pub name they said it would be too difficult to do but we had an answer for that robertson said we had a suspicion before the demolition that they would do something so we asked historic england to think about listing it they took a plaster cast of every tile they took pictures and documented everything with nowhere left to turn the developers started the rebuild and to be fair to ctlx they have done amazing work robertson said it looks fantastic although praise for the demolishers goes only so far i doubt they will be at the reopening the community would eat them alive she said polly robertson local campaigner with the carlton tavern s new owners tom rees and ben martin right photograph sophia evans the observer the carlton tavern s wooden doors fittings and tiled signs are remarkably similar to photographs taken before the new leaseholders are tom rees and ben martin who set up homegrown pubs last year and they are still putting the finishing touches to the fit out lots of parts of the bar and the fireplace the bannister have been reclaimed from the rubble rees said the pub tells its story from the half broken fixtures that we ve got you can see bits of broken wood it s not all perfect which we really love because it gives character and charm to the building rees and martin have restored the cellar which will be stocked by local london brewers including the camden town brewery five points from hackney the london brewing co and anspach hobday ben and i have been running pubs and restaurants for a long time and we decided to set up our company rees said i live locally and i knew about the pub this has happened multiple times in different places and there s never been a result like this from the outside it seems like a totally mad thing to do setting up a pub company during the middle of the pandemic but from the inside landlords have had the upper hand with leaseholders for ever so this was an opportunity to level the playing field across the industry the new carlton will focus more on food although rees fights shy of the word gastropub we want it to be a great little boozer where you can come and have some pints of cask any day of the week but we ll also have a nice dining area out the back we hope we can be everything to everyone james watson the pub protection adviser for the campaign for pubs advised the carlton campaign i never imagined that i would see a planning inspector order a developer to put back what he d just knocked down to look exactly as it was i thought the developer would get a slap on the wrist a fine but i was flabbergasted and it has set an incredibly useful precedent other planning inspectors will remember it and so will developers watson was involved in campaigning for legislation in that went some way to stopping pubs from being converted into shops under permitted development rules full planning permission is now required most developers tend to be slightly smarter than sending in the bulldozers he said the age old trick is to take some tiles off the roof and let the rain in the beams rot it collapses and they say to the council this is a derelict site that needs to be rebuilt as flats councils in cambridge and london are questioning this method more and more watson said they re challenging these trojan horse attacks on pubs where they say they re going to put a bike shed in the basement and a gym upstairs and suddenly your pub space is just a lock up we need other councils around the country to do the same he said planning officers need to be wise to these tricks,pos

dea finally ends fed monopoly on schwaggy research grade cannabis politics dea finally ends fed monopoly on schwaggy research grade cannabis bruce kennedy may for decades american researchers have been forced to use only poor quality low thc cannabis grown by a mississippi contractor now the dea is allowing others who know how to grow good cannabis to supply research grade weed to scientists adobestock late last week the u s drug enforcement administration dea quietly made an announcement that s expected to have a profound and long lasting impact on cannabis research and development in the united states in its statement the dea said it was nearing the end of its review of certain marijuana grower applications thereby allowing it to soon register additional entities authorized to produce marijuana for research purposes in other words the feds are ending their monopoly on cannabis grown for scientific purposes and that means american researchers can for the first time ever conduct studies using real world cannabis instead of the terrible low thc schwag they ve been forced to use for decades nida monopoly since there are several reasons why this is a big deal since the only federally approved supplier of cannabis for research purposes in the united states has been a acre farm run by the national center for the development of natural products at the university of mississippi that production has been exclusively for the national institute on drug abuse nida which maintains control over the production and distribution of research grade cannabis in the united states over the years the mississippi weed farm has earned a notorious reputation for growing some of the worst cannabis in the world leafly s ben adlin documented the shockingly poor quality in this article smoking thc studying thc the poor quality and low potency of the government grown cannabis has been an ongoing issue for u s cannabis researchers the inadequacy of nida cannabis has led to some high profile academic disputes lawsuits and national headlines as well as well founded accusations that the dea was dragging its feet on the issue in rick doblin founder and executive director of the multidisciplinary association for psychedelic studies maps declared that nida was completely inadequate as a source of marijuana for drug development research for years nida and the dea have promised to open up the sourcing of federally approved research cannabis but nothing happened related wasn t the dea going to let others grow research grade cannabis dea finally relents on may however the dea announced that a number of manufacturers applications to cultivate marijuana for research needs in the united states appears to be consistent with applicable legal standards and relevant laws as a result and pending final approval the agency has given preliminary approval to several organizations to grow cannabis for research at the moment only three organizations have been publicly named as approved new growers for research pennsylvania based groff north america the scottsdale research institute sri in arizona and biopharmaceutical research company brc in california monumental step for george hodgin a former navy seal who is the founder and ceo of brc the dea s announcement is nothing but good news up until now research institutions biotech firms and other private companies had few if any options for federally legal cannabis r d he said in an email to leafly this monumental step from the dea means that brc can now position itself as that all in one source for reliable and safe research and cultivation hodgin noted that companies like his also want research organizations to have more choices in the marketplace ensuring that the quality of the product is comparable to the supply used by cannabis patients as well as recreational users the dea announcement he added will unleash a new wave of job creation in the cannabis sector and at the same time begin to develop valuable american ip intellectual property this just wasn t really possible before this decision real world cannabis finally available for matthew zorn a houston based attorney the dea s decision is historic zorn was the co lead lawyer in a freedom of information foia lawsuit scottsdale research v doj dea filed last year as a result of that lawsuit filed on behalf of sri the department of justice released a previously confidential memo from that concluded the dea s long standing policy on marijuana research violated federal law as well as u s treaty obligations sri has made cannabis research headlines for years now most recently for groundbreaking studies administered by sue sisley a medical doctor who conducted clinic trials with military veterans to determine if cannabis is a safe and well tolerated treatment for managing post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and pain with the dea announcement zorn told leafly scientists will be able to clinically study the types of cannabis that are being used with real world cannabis a lot of people may not appreciate the importance of that with national cannabis legalization around the corner we don t know when but the need for this research is urgent we can as quickly as possible start growing and have a supply for researchers to get good data breaking down barriers to research the promise to end nida s cannabis monopoly zorn noted is the first step towards addressing the longstanding argument by cannabis legalization opponents that there s no rigorous data in the u s that has shown the medicinal benefits of cannabis everything s been limited to observational studies he said and it s true clinical studies have taken place overseas but the biggest criticism right now against medicinal marijuana and marijuana legalization more generally is that there isn t enough data and research that is directly traceable to this nida monopoly and now hopefully we re going to get answers fueling innovation in the cannabis sector for his part brc s george hodgin sees the start of a new era of cannabis research and development fueled in part by a new players in the marketplace now there s competition which this space has needed so badly for such a long time he said we re ready to compete that s what we ve been waiting for years to do the decision to issue these licenses in my view will lead to an incredible rush of innovation in the healthcare space but according to hodgin these developments will depend on more than rapid change quality is just as important he said you can have the best research institutions in the world researching cannabis but if the quality of the samples does not match what is actually in use the research isn t all that helpful so i think the competition will increase the speed there s not a doubt about that but i also think the quality is going to be a crucial part of driving the innovation as well bruce kennedy bruce kennedy is an award winning reporter editor and producer based in colorado

operating a gang of hit squads bent on eliminating perceived enemies it s official golden dawn is over the conviction is overwhelming said petros constantinou a leading anti racism activist the mood here today is resonant of the celebrations we saw with the liberation of athens from the nazis it s a great day wrapping up a trial that began in april the presiding judge maria lepenioti said the court had concluded that seven of golden dawn s former mps including the party founder nikolaos michaloliakos had led the deadly organisation the rest were found culpable of participating in the gang greek court s ruling on golden dawn party met with jubilation video the verdict was met with widespread relief magda fyssa whose son pavlos fyssas an anti fascist rapper was stabbed to death by a senior party operative and who attended almost every court session over the past five and half years screamed with emotion pavlos did it my son she wailed outside the courtroom the greek president katerina sakellaropoulou said the judgment was an important day for democracy and evidence that greek institutions were able to fend off any attempt to undermine them before the verdict the public prosecutor overseeing the case recommended the acquittal of many key party members in relation to the criminal organisation charge citing lack of evidence a recommendation that was roundly denounced by critics who accused the magistrate of typifying the toxic influence wielded by conservatives over the justice system the hearing was the biggest trial of fascists since the prosecution of the nazis at nuremberg after the second world war two thousand police officers many brought in as backup from the countryside amid fears of violent clashes between the protesters and far right supporters surrounded the area near the court as helicopters and drones flew overhead clashes did break out as rocks and molotov cocktails were hurled at police who responded with teargas and water cannon the violence was attributed to a minority of anti establishment forces the leftist former prime minister alexis tsipras who was in the crowd said that after years of sowing hate poisoning greek society

down by the criminal court are likely to be longer although justice officials said it may take several days of legal proceedings before they are formally announced the accused vigorously denied the charges claiming they were victims of political persecution michaloliakos a holocaust denier and ardent admirer of hitler whose neofascist beliefs began to take form during greece s military

golden dawn members have already been found guilty of the killing of a pakistani fruit worker ssazad lukman in athens in january the court examined evidence that ranged from the testimonies of victims and five former golden dawn members now in witness protection programmes to incriminating videos snatched from the homes of party leaders and heard that the attacks increased in frequency after the party s entry into the greek parliament in at the height of greece s debilitating debt crisis golden dawn riding a tidal wave of popular anger with eu mandated austerity measures won seats in the member house to become the country s third biggest political force in the last general election in july last year the neo nazis narrowly failed to win enough votes to win any seats in parliament and the party has all but collapsed amid infighting and defections since then the accusations against the leaders and members of golden dawn including the murder of pavlos fyssas expose a fissure that

with an aggressive anti migrant and anti human rights stance will be felt far beyond greece s borders the central board of jewish communities in greece kise said the historic verdict delegitimises the

big risks the global climate risk index issued by think tank germanwatch ranked pakistan fifth on a list of countries most affected by planetary heating over the last years even though the south asian nation contributes only a fraction of global greenhouse gases as the coronavirus pandemic struck pakistan the billion trees campaign was initially halted as part of social distancing orders put in place to slow the spread of the virus which has infected more than people in pakistan according to a tally by johns hopkins university but earlier this month the prime minister granted an exemption to allow the forestry agency to restart the programme and create more than jobs according to government officials a recent assessment by the pakistan institute of development economics found that due to

change saying there also needed to be an investment in improving the ability of farmers and city dwellers to adapt to the effects of a hotter planet the government should be very selective on how it spends money and focus on resilience he urged for aslam the green jobs initiative is a way to help pakistan s workers recover from the coronavirus crisis with dignity and avoiding handouts this has

dame has been built over many centuries and that he took comfort in the way the british had repaired windsor castle after the fire of but it s hard to believe that this is happening in paris part of ourselves has been destroyed he said i always go for a walk in this area every day and come to see notre dame it s like coming to visit an elderly parent one commuter said i come often to notre dame for mass and to pray and the damage is tearing at my heart but he added luckily it was saved it was not completely destroyed and as the president said we will have money to rebuild it and i hope it

people across france a visibly upset emmanuel macron walking near the notre dame cathedral as it burns left and locals watch on helplessly r but he asked should it be rebuilt exactly the same as before will it be like the louvre will we have a pyramid in the middle of it another onlooker who gave his name only as clement said as sad as it is it reminds us that buildings are just temporary just as we are during the french revolution in the th century the cathedral was vandalised in widespread anti catholic violence its spire was dismantled its treasures plundered and its large statues at the grand entrance doors destroyed it would go on to feature as a central character in a victor hugo novel published in the hunchback of notre dame and shortly afterwards a restoration project lasting two decades got under way led by architect eugene viollet le duc the building survived the devastation of two global conflicts in the th century and famously rang its bells on august the day of the liberation of paris from german occupation at the end of the world war ii before yesterday s blaze it was in the midst of renovations with some sections under scaffolding and bronze statues had been removed last week for works its ft long roof of which a large section was consumed in the first hour of the blaze was one of the oldest such structures in paris parisians took to the city s streets last night to pray sing and reminisce about notre dame cathedral as it burned before them the emotions became too much for some locals who gathered in the shadow of the cathedral to watch its slow destruction i walked through the gutted cathedral then the crucifix shone from what remained of the altar a symbol of defiance in the gloom robert hardman is among first witnesses inside ravaged notre dame sparks and bits of flaming woodwork are still cascading from the remnants of the th century roof the smell instantly sears the back of your throat like a dose of smelling salts and my feet are soaked the ancient black and white tiles leading up the aisle are under a gently flowing river of hose water from the fire crews pumping what seems like much of the river seine from their elevated platforms yet i can faithfully report that the cathedral of notre dame is not entirely destroyed because i am standing inside it alongside the french prime minister in the early hours of this morning i was among the first people to be allowed inside the ruins of one of the world s finest cathedrals following the fire which has shocked not just the entire french nation but much of the planet a blaze which begin in the cathedral s loft at pm had turned into an all consuming catastrophe by nightfall officials reported that the wooden interior of the medieval cathedral had been almost completely destroyed certainly notre dame s spire is no more great chunks of its eastern end are no more its world famous stained glass windows are in smithereens and the whole edifice is open to the skies robert hardman was given access to the charred remains of the notre dame cathedral in the early hours of tuesday morning smoke is seen around the alter inside notre dame cathedral on monday evening miracolously the cross and altar have managed to survive the inferno but paris will wake today to see that the cathedral that has defied world wars enemy occupations revolutions and mobs galore is still poking its head above the paris skyline and at am today at the far end of the cathedral illuminated by lingering embers and firefighters equipment i could just make out a stunning symbol of defiance through the gloom the unmistakeable sight of a crucifix on what remains of the altar notre dame is gravely damaged yet its most spectacular features the year old twin towers are still there for centuries these were the highest structures in paris until the eiffel tower came along to this day they are instantly recognisable the world over and last night though looking very sorry for themselves they were in one piece as i stood beneath them alongside a posse of fire crews and prime ministerial aides within hours speculation was rife as to the cause of the fire for now it seems that it was what one official called a stray flame linked to a million restoration project which sparked the inferno experts have warned for years that the cathedral has been in a poor condition with the french state reluctant to fund renovation work in recent decades experts said that the building needed a million million restoration but the state had only offered million pictures taken outside the cathedral and from the entrance hall in the early hours of tuesday show emergency service personnel still working to make the site safe massive plumes of yellow brown smoke is filling the air above notre dame cathedral and ash is falling on tourists and others around the island that marks the centre of paris firefighters can be seen on the left fighting the fire the cathedral was seeking private donations to make up the rest the flames were first spotted just minutes after the building had closed to the public for the day echoing the fears of his entire country french president emmanuel macron instantly declared a national emergency our lady of paris in flames he declared on twitter like all our countrymen i m sad tonight to see this part of us burn he has pledged to rebuild notre dame saying notre dame is our history our imagination where we ve lived all our great moments and is the epicentre of our lives it s the story of our books our paintings it s the cathedral for all french people even if they have never been but it is burning and i know this sadness will be felt by all of our citizens tomorrow a national subscription will be launched for people around the country to help rebuild this great notre dame because that s what the french people want that is what their history requires because that is our destiny questions were immediately asked about the way in which a fire could take such a rapid hold of one of the world s most visited and most beloved landmarks the firefighting response was also questioned as few if any high pressure water hoses were able to reach the roof in the first hour critically the paris prosecutor has already opened an enquiry i arrived last night to find a dumbstruck city of light still bathed in a dismal afterglow here on the banks of the seine tens of thousands of people of all nationalities stared incredulously at the slow death of a part of france s soul the fire spread rapidly across the roof line of the cathedral leaving one of the spires and another section of the roof engulfed in flames to describe the cathedral of notre dame as a national monument is a grave understatement imagine westminster abbey st paul s cathedral and the tower of london all going up in smoke at the same time and you begin to appreciate the magnitude of this loss except that notre dame attracts or used to attract twice as many annual visitors as those three london landmarks put together that is why as news began to spread last night parisians flocked to the seine they came here not as voyeurs but as mourners they came to pay their last respects some sang hymns many were in tears some brought flowers and cards to place they knew not where understandably perhaps no one saw fit to light a candle from medieval times notre dame has marked the epochs in the story of this proud country and inspired one of the most famous literary masterpieces in the french language the hunchback of notre dame this august marks the th anniversary of the day that general charles de gaulle marked the liberation of paris within its walls even as sporadic gunfire continued outside this is a city which was famously spared the destruction which history has wreaked on so many other european capitals it really did feel blessed almost eternal not any more those twin towers are now blackened and wide open to the elements by midnight however the flames had died down as the first glimmers of firemen s torches could be seen here and there in the remains i joined what i can only describe as a requiem mass of parisians chanting prayers on the pont de notre dame all approaches to the cathedral s island site had been sealed off to the public but crowds kept on coming from all directions for a glimpse at least the two towers are still standing and they must stay up so that notre dame can be reborn said civil servant pascal boichut there was a glimmer of hope when paris fire brigade chief jean claude gallet told reporters we consider that the main structure of notre dame has been preserved in a statement the ceo of the kering group which owns gucci and yves saint laurent fashion houses said the money towards the effort necessary to completely rebuild notre dame would be paid by the pinault family s investment firm artemis macron had earlier cancelled a major televised policy speech he was due to give on monday evening to respond to months of protests and instead headed to the scene in person he said while the worst had been avoided and the facade and two towers saved the next hours

authorities have revealed they are unable to drop water on to notre dame to tame the blaze for fear it will ruin what is left of the year old cathedral as well as injuring people nearby the tactic was suggested by us president donald trump on twitter but it hasn t been deployed because of the risks it could pose not only to the historic building but to any people nearby the french interior ministry tweeted to say that firefighters have been mobilised to help tackle the blaze that is engulfing the cathedral the french interior ministry has tweeted to say firefighters have been mobilised to help tackle the blaze in cases of intense fires a water bomber jet called a canadair can be deployed to drop large amounts of water hundreds of comments have flooded in on the pompiers du paris twitter page in support of the brave firefighters risking their lives to save notre dame french news site le monde explains a canadair projects about six tonnes of water at high speed to the ground the danger is significant of hurting one or more people around the building which is why canadair interventions are so infrequent in urban and peri urban areas such an intervention could also significantly destroy the little remaining structure of the cathedral the french interior ministry have mobilised firefighters to help tackle the blazing inferno which has been burning for if an accident happens while a canadair is being used the pilot may also face criminal charges canadairs were used earlier this year in march when france experienced intense wildfires near valdeblore in the alpes maritimes they were also used in when france experienced intense wildfires that forced people to evacuate their homes and campsites overnight the french interior ministry has mobilised firefighters to help

north dakota quietly decriminalized marijuana north dakota quietly decriminalized marijuana earlier this month making it the th state to do so as the news outlet marijuana moment and the advocacy group norml reported republican gov doug burgum signed a bill decriminalizing marijuana last week but the issue got little to no attention from his office or news media the law makes it so first time possession of up to half an ounce of marijuana is no longer a criminal misdemeanor that carries the potential for jail time but instead is an infraction that only carries a fine this is different from marijuana legalization under decriminalization possession of small amounts of pot no longer carries jail or prison time but can continue to carry a fine and possession of larger amounts repeat offenses and sales or trafficking can still result in harsher sentences under legalization penalties for marijuana possession are completely removed and sales are typically allowed some opponents of legalization favor decriminalization as a step toward peeling back america s harsh drug and criminal justice policies they see tough on crime policies as too punitive and costly but they don t want to resort to full legalization which they fear would make pot too accessible in the us and allow big corporations to sell and market the drug irresponsibly the concern for legalization advocates is that decriminalization keeps the ban on selling marijuana which means users wouldn t have a legal source for the drug and criminal organizations would therefore still have a source of revenue that they can use for violent operations around the world the fines while less punitive than arrests or prison time can also cause problems since they re often applied in a racially disparate manner ten states and washington dc have legalized marijuana although dc and vermont don t allow sales fifteen additional states now including north dakota have only decriminalized north dakota voters rejected a marijuana legalization ballot initiative last year but activists reportedly will try again in supporters of legalization argue that it eliminates the harms of marijuana prohibition the hundreds of thousands of arrests around the us the racial disparities behind those arrests and the billions of dollars that flow from the black market for illicit marijuana to drug cartels that then use the money for violent operations around the world all of this legalization advocates say will outweigh any of the potential downsides such as increased cannabis use that might come with legalization opponents meanwhile claim that legalization will enable a huge marijuana industry that will market the drug irresponsibly they point to america s experiences with the alcohol and tobacco industries in particular which have built their financial empires in large part on some of the heaviest consumers of their products this could result in far more people using pot even if it leads to negative health consequences for now legalization is not reality in north dakota but decriminalization is for more on marijuana legalization read vox s explainer,pos

this high schooler invented color changing sutures to detect infection dasia taylor has juiced about three dozen beets in the last months the root vegetables she s found provide the perfect dye for her invention suture thread that changes color from bright red to dark purple when a surgical wound becomes infected the year old student at iowa city west high school in iowa city iowa began working on the project in october after her chemistry teacher shared information about state wide science fairs with the class as she developed her sutures she nabbed awards at several regional science fairs before advancing to the national stage this january taylor was named one of finalists in the regeneron science talent search the country s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors as any science fair veteran knows at the core of a successful project is a problem in need of solving taylor had read about sutures coated with a conductive material that can sense the status of a wound by changes in electrical resistance and relay that information to the smartphones or computers of patients and doctors while these smart sutures could help in the united states the expensive tool might be less applicable to people in developing countries where internet access and mobile technology is sometimes lacking and yet the need is there on average percent of surgical wounds develop an infection in low and middle incoming countries according to the world health organization compared to between and percent of surgeries in the u s infections after cesarean sections particularly caught taylor s attention in some african nations up to percent of women who give birth by c section then develop surgical site infections research has also shown that health centers in sierra leone the democratic republic of the congo and burundi have similar or lower rates of infection at between and percent following c sections than the u s where rates range from to percent but smartphone access is markedly different a bbc survey published in found that in sierra leone about percent of people own mobile phones and about three quarters of those owned basic cell phones not smartphones i ve done a lot of racial equity work in my community i ve been a guest speaker at several conferences says taylor so when i was presented with this opportunity to do research i couldn t help but go at it with an equity lens before the covid pandemic taylor spent most of her time after school in the black history game show a club she s been a member of since eighth grade and attending weekly school board and district meetings to advocate for an anti racist curriculum for the four months leading up to her first regional science fair in february taylor committed friday afternoons to research under the guidance of her chemistry teacher carolyn walling healthy human skin is naturally acidic with a ph around five but when a wound becomes infected its ph goes up to about nine changes in ph can be detected without electronics many fruits and vegetables are natural indicators that change color at different ph levels i found that beets changed color at the perfect ph point says taylor bright red beet juice turns dark purple at a ph of nine that s perfect for an infected wound and so i was like oh okay so beets is where it s at next taylor had to find a suture thread that would hold onto the dye she tested ten different materials including standard suture thread for how well they picked up and held the dye whether the dye changed color when its ph changed and how their thickness compared to standard suture thread after her school transitioned to remote learning she could spend four or five hours in the lab on an asynchronous lesson day running experiments a cotton polyester blend checked all the boxes after five minutes under an infection like ph the cotton polyester thread changes from bright red to dark purple after three days the purple fades to light gray working with an eye on equity in global health she hopes that the color changing sutures will someday help patients detect surgical site infections as early as possible so that they can seek medical care when it has the most impact taylor plans to patent her invention in the meantime she s waiting for her final college admissions results to get to the top this is like post doctoral work that these kids are doing says maya ajmera the president and ceo of the society for science which runs the science talent search this year s top prizes went to a matching algorithm that can find pairs in an infinite pool of options a computer model that can help identify useful compounds for pharmaceutical research and a sustainable drinking water filtration system the finalists also voted to grant taylor the seaborg award making her a spokesperson for their cohort kathryn chu the director of the center for global surgery at stellenbosch university in south africa focuses on improving equitable access to surgical care i think it is amazing that this young high school scientist was inspired to work on a solution to address this problem the surgeon writes in an email a product that could detect early surgical site infections would be extremely valuable however she adds how this concept could translate from the bench to the bedside needs further testing current suture threads are good at their job they re affordable they re not irritating on the skin and they are strong enough to hold a wound together the beet juice dyed thread will need to be competitive on all of these attributes surgical site infections can also occur below the surface of a wound a c section involves cutting through and then repairing not just the skin but also the muscle underneath as it stands the color changing suture thread wouldn t help detect an infection below the skin and if the infection oozes through the skin or involves the skin the infection has already reached later stages writes chu lastly the same non absorbency that makes standard suture thread hard to dye with beet juice also keeps bacteria out and vice versa while cotton thread s braided structure gives it the ability to pick up the beet dye it also provides a hiding place for bacteria that cause infections taylor has been pursuing a line of research since the beginning of her project that might counteract the risks posed by using cotton i read some studies that said beet juice was antibacterial and although i want to take their word i wanted to try it for myself i wanted to reproduce their results says taylor but studying bacteria requires specific sterile practices that neither taylor nor her mentors walling and michelle wikner both chemistry teachers were initially familiar with in the months leading up to the science talent search competition taylor connected with microbiologist theresa ho at university of iowa to create a research plan incorporating the proper techniques and that work is ongoing reflecting on the science fair experience taylor most wants to thank carolyn walling for encouraging her to participate we re kind of basking in all of this together she says especially because it s her first year doing independent research she s also thankful for the support of her community i have so much school pride because when somebody in our school does something great they re celebrated to its fullest extent says taylor and being able to be one of those kids has been so amazing after graduation taylor hopes to attend howard university study political science and eventually become a lawyer i am looking forward to seeing how dasia uses this project moving forward says ajmera and on a long term scale i m really interested in watching what problems she is going to continue to solve

black man has convinced racists to abandon the kkk he said he had to beat up two kkk followers after they a black man has single handedly caused more than white racists to leave the ku klux klan simply by confronting their prejudice with friendship inspirational daryl davis a blues musician and author has travelled all over the us since the early s actively seeking out and befriending members of the openly racist organisation the kkk is a white supremacy cult founded in organizing members to persecute people for the color of their skin or their religious beliefs daryl davis stands at a burning of the cross ceremony with kkk members in the background the burning is synonymous with the group who do it as a mark of their religion and for intimidation daryl with the distinctive white costume and face mask he said by befriending members he convinced white racists to leave the group but daryl davis has been battling the hatred and answering a call he has felt since he was a young man when he decided to confront the ideology of the kkk head on one member at a time he has since documented his incredible mission in the book klan destine relationships a black man s odyssey in the ku klux klan which is set to be re released with an updated version next year daryl from chicago has also found time for a celebrated music career in r b and blues playing alongside the likes of jerry lee lewis chuck berry and former president bill clinton and he counted the legendary muddy waters among his friends daryl said music absolutely played a massive role in bridging many gaps in the racial divides i would encounter once when i was performing in a predominantly white venue a white man approached me on my break and put his arm around me and exclaimed this is the first time i ve ever heard a black man play piano like jerry lee lewis the musician has met many prominent members of the white supremacist group and has made friends along the way i quickly enlightened him as to the origin of jerry lee s music and told him that jerry lee had learned that style from black boogie woogie and blues piano players the man did not believe me despite the fact that i further told him that jerry lee was a good friend of mine and he had told me himself where he learned that style but the gentleman was fascinated with the idea that a black man could play like that he was curious and wanted to learn more about me it was then revealed to me by him that he was a member of the ku klux klan over time he and i became good friends he ended up leaving the kkk daryl said he is never unprepared for violence from those he meets as any member he confronts can potentially be someone who would want to do him harm in those rare cases he said one of them ended up in hospital and the other in jail some of them are absolutely repulsed when they see a black person and want to hurt that person said daryl he said there have been some incidents in which i was threatened and a couple of instances where i had to physically fight fortunately i won in both instances these things happen from time to time but it is to be expected because you are dealing with someone who hates you and wants to be violent just because of the colour of your skin some of them are absolutely repulsed when they see a black person and want to hurt that person at the core of it although they won t at first admit it they express superiority but truly feel inferiority and in order to elevate themselves they have to push someone else down a meeting that could have ended up in violence was when daryl met a grand dragon a rank in the kkk in maryland a man called roger kelly daryl said i was very well prepared for the meeting in terms of knowledge of my topic i have just about every book written on the klan and i ve read them all in fact i know more about the kkk than most klan members know about their own organisation knowledge information wit and the way you disseminate these attributes can often prove to be a more disarming weapon against an enemy or some with whom your ideology is in conflict than violence or lethal weapons i was heavily armed with those attributes i had been told by someone who knew him very well that roger kelly would kill me i felt confident without any physical weapon that i would prevail fortunately i proved it true in fact daryl said he was so successful in his prevailing that the kkk branch in maryland is now non existent with perhaps four people turning up for a meeting and two of them are drunk the kkk calls for the white purification of the us and have killed black people in its long history he said it s a wonderful thing when you see a light bulb pop on in their heads or they call you and tell you they are quitting i never set out to convert anyone in the klan i just set out to get an answer to my question how can you hate me when you don t even know me i simply gave them a chance to get to know me and treat them the way i want to be treated they come to their own conclusion that this ideology is no longer for them i am often the impetus for coming to that conclusion and i m very happy that some positivity has come out of my meetings and friendships with them daryl traveled a lot as a child as his parents served with the american foreign service and he said it was that experience of different cultures that helped him see just how alien the idea of racism is daryl at another kkk burning of the cross even he also alluded to the us election saying that all racists he knows voted for donald trump but not all trump supporters are racist he said when i would return home every two years it baffled me as to why people judged others by their skin colour this was a very strange concept to me this is a quote from the american author mark twain which i find to be most accurate travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrow mindedness and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts broad wholesome charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one s lifetime despite his incredible work daryl does receive some mixed reactions to making friendships with people who have held such extremist views he said there was surprise and shock on both sides black and white mostly from people who don t know me or who haven t bothered to research me read up on me or hear my interviews or lectures not all but most of the criticism has come from black people i have been called a sellout uncle tom oreo and a number of other terrible names unfortunately i must compare these particular black people with the kkk and other white supremacist groups with no distinction other than the colour of their skin davis with a klan member he said that most racists he knows voted for donald trump in the november presidential election this is because they are engaging in the exact same hateful behaviour as they accuse the white racists i can explain it like this because i ve seen it on both sides daryl said america today was probably less racist than it had been in the past but that he continues his work every day in israel it s palestinian versus jew in lebanon it s christian versus muslim in iraq it s sunni muslim versus shiite muslim in certain african countries the conflict is tribal in india we see a caste system based on the shade of skin color and classicism there has always been a great deal of racism in the u s before and after obama however racism in the us is down post obama what you are seeing is those people who were dormant racists being given a new lease on life by the sentiments of our new president elect,pos

young man invents water you can eat to help dementia patients like his grandma stay hydrated people with alzheimer s and other forms of dementia often suffer from dehydration issues for a variety of reasons one of those reasons is that dementia patients may simply forget to drink water or forget where to find water even if there s a cup of it on the nightstand inches away from them others may no longer find water palatable and forget that it is necessary since they might not feel thirsty still others may even forget how to drink water or how to swallow dementia patients who suffer from dysphagia a swallowing difficulty often have a hard time swallowing thin liquids and require thickening agents to help them get the hydration they need when a patient reaches the last stages of dementia and is no longer getting the water they need due to one of the reasons listed above they rely on the help of caretakers to provide water laden foods and thickened or flavored beverages to combat dehydration none of the current methods will prevent people with dementia from dying of their disease as there is currently no cure for the issue but getting creative with hydration techniques can keep people with memory loss problems from experiencing the discomfort and pain of excessive thirst developing other dehydration related health issues and even dying of dehydration a young man named lewis hornby noticed that his grandmother who suffers from dementia was not getting enough to drink and decided to invent something that would make it easier for her to get the fluids she needed so he used sensory deprivation tools and vr tools to get a better understanding of the issue spoke with a dementia psychologist spent a week living in a dementia care home consulted with doctors about how to create a hydrating product and returned to the care home several times to test the prototypes of his project all in an effort to do something to help article continues below our featured programs see how we re making a difference for people pets and the planet and how you can get involved learn more for people with dementia the symptoms of dehydration are often mistakenly attributed to their underlying condition meaning it can easily go unnoticed until it becomes life threatening hornby writes on the james dyson award website about a year ago my grandma was unexpectedly rushed to hospital she was found to be severely dehydrated thankfully after hours on iv fluids she was back to her normal happy self and is still enjoying a good quality of life to this day what hornby came up with were jelly drops brightly colored bite sized balls of liquid that are easier to swallow than water but just as hydrating the drops are made of percent water with gelling agents and electrolytes to aid in hydration the drops don t require any utensils are firm and easy to grasp and don t leave any residue on the hands the packaging doesn t look like a medical device of any sort so it s not threatening instead it looks like an inviting box of candies hornby says he s found that people with dementia immediately recognize the colorful jelly drops as a treat and are eager to eat them even if they would normally turn down other types of food or drinks when first offered grandma ate jelly drops in minutes says hornby the equivalent to a cup full of water something that would usually take hours and require much more assistance hornby carefully thought through the packaging of his jelly drops as well the clear plastic box allows patients to see the goodies inside without lifting the lid making the jelly drops easier to find if misplaced and easier to remember to eat there s also a special handle on one corner so that users can open the lid without putting down the box then a locking hinge holds the lid in its upright position freeing a hand to eat with this is particularly important since many dementia patients struggle to plan and execute sequences of actions jelly drops have won the helen hamlyn design award snowdon award for disability and the dyson school of design engineering desire award for social impact they are being trialed in other care homes in the uk and hornby hopes to do more research and begin production of his drops soon hopefully this ingenious invention will help thousands of current and future dementia patients get the hydration they need to stay comfortable healthy and alive and enjoy it at the same time check out the video below to see how much hornby s grandma pat enjoys her jelly drops thank you lewis hornby for harnessing your compassion for your grandmother into an innovative product that will help so many people get the fluids they need to survive your creativity and dedication are admirable and the world needs more people like you,pos

the global crackdown on parents who refuse vaccines for their kids is on there s a school of thought that refusing vaccines on behalf of your children amounts to child abuse and that parents should be punished for their decision we know vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective at preventing the spread of disease and failing to immunize children can put them and vulnerable people around them at tremendous risk of illness or even death when outbreaks occur now it seems that germany australia and a number of other countries are fed up enough with vaccine refusing parents that they re experimenting with punitive measures we haven t quite reached the level of child abuse charges but moms and dads in these countries may face fines if they fail to give their kids the recommended shots in australia the directors of schools that let in the unvaccinated kids would be fined too this marks a pretty aggressive shift in how we manage vaccine refusers and the costly deadly outbreaks of diseases like measles and whooping cough they help spark here s a quick roundup of the global crackdown on vaccine refusing parents in germany on thursday lawmakers passed a law stating that parents need to prove they ve vaccinated their kids against measles or risk fines up to about unvaccinated children also risk losing their places in school on thursday lawmakers passed a law stating that parents need to prove they ve vaccinated their kids against measles or risk fines up to about unvaccinated children also risk losing their places in school italy s parliament passed a law that makes childhood vaccinations mandatory for kids up to age and requires parents to prove their children are immunized before entering school or else face a about noncompliance fine and kids who aren t vaccinated are being told not to come to school that makes childhood vaccinations mandatory for kids up to age and requires parents to prove their children are immunized before entering school or else

mandatory for children though there s no talk of a fine yet the health ministry made vaccines up from the current three diphtheria tetanus and polio mandatory for children though there s no talk of a

un immunized children australian dollars the law in new south wales is modeled on similarly stringent laws in other australian states and across the country parents with children who aren t immunized

immunized children australian dollars the law in new south wales is modeled on similarly stringent laws in other australian states and across the country parents with children who aren t immunized aren t eligible for child care benefits in the us new york where a large measles outbreak raged on for nearly a year the government threatened parents who don t vaccinate their children with a fine of up to these fines come amid a growing problem with measles globally over the past two years measles cases have been edging up in countries around the world with a percent rise in cases over the same period in according to the world health organization many countries where measles had been declared eliminated have recently lost that status including britain greece brazil france and germany with more than measles cases this year the largest number for any year since the us also nearly lost its measles elimination status before we consider punishing american parents we might try this here vaccine skeptics have also been persuading more parents in a number of states to refuse shots for their children so is the us ready for a similar crackdown punishing parents for doing things that could harm their kids is not without precedent in the us for example there are laws in various states requiring parents to use car seats or seat belts for their children or else pay a fine or be docked driver s license points same goes for firearm storage laws but before we start fining anti vaxxers there are some much more basic steps the us could take that would improve vaccination rates and they involve simply making it harder for parents to opt out of routine shots on behalf of their kids vaccines fall under the public health jurisdiction of the states and there s currently a lot of variation across the us when it comes to immunization requirements even though all states have legislation requiring vaccines for students entering school states allow exemptions for people with religious beliefs against immunizations and states currently grant philosophical exemptions for those opposed to vaccines because of personal or moral beliefs the exceptions are mississippi california and west virginia and more recently new york and maine which now have the strictest vaccine laws in the nation allowing only medical exemptions perhaps unsurprisingly the parts of the country that make it easier for people to opt out of their shots tend to have higher rates of people opting out of vaccines so a lax regulatory environment can create space for more parents to refuse vaccines that s why some states have been moving to crack down on this trend most notably california which is already seeing success in terms of boosting vaccine coverage rates in another measles outbreak prompted california s former governor jerry brown to sign a bill sb that abolished all nonmedical exemptions and the california experience is instructive for other states that might want to close some of their loopholes according to the state health department the number of kindergarten students in the school year with all their required vaccines was percent a percentage point increase over and the second highest reported vaccine rate since health authorities started tracking a recent analysis published in jama put the opt out rate at percent by hidden within that increase is some conflicting data said saad omer director of the yale institute for global health since the law was enacted medical exemptions have also increased suggesting there may be an unintended effect of the crackdown on nonmedical exemptions that s because something else was going on in california and it offset that increase in medical exemptions in parallel with abolishing nonmedical exemptions through sb california launched the conditional entrant intervention project in the idea was that public health professionals would work with local health departments to identify schools granting high rates of conditional entrants and work with them to bring them down between and omer and his colleagues found a sharp percent decline in the conditional admission rate so even with the rise in medical exemptions the overall vaccine exemption rate still went down thanks to the decline in conditional vaccine entry to schools omer told vox i m not discounting eliminating nonmedical exemptions it s a reasonable option but it may not resolve all issues that s why california is now cracking down on bogus medical exemptions too that means simply outlawing nonmedical exemptions may not be a panacea in states that have a high percentage of parents using their social capital to spread anti vaccine views and as we saw in california a ban on nonmedical exemptions could even backfire if other vaccine loopholes are left open but lawmakers should look for ways that make it more inconvenient to opt out by doing things like introducing exemptions with regular renewals fewer than a dozen states require annual or more frequent recertification for medical exemptions so for example if a child in a k school gets an exemption in kindergarten it will follow them through to college she ll never be asked to renew that exemption or lawmakers could crack down on the conditional entry to school and they should move fast the percentage of people seeking nonmedical exemptions while still small has also been creeping upward from percent in to percent by outbreaks in recent years have also been getting larger omer said that s the canary in the coal mine for me,pos

i think my gmail has crashed the teacher who made bernie sanders mittens on watching them go viral joe biden s inauguration doubled as a promenade of style featuring thousand dollar dior air jordan s monochromatic jewel toned looks and a skirt so wide it enforced its own sartorial social distancing but the fashion icon who stole the show was of all people sen bernie sanders whose casual fit became instant meme fodder with special attention paid to his extremely cozy looking mittens eagle eyed observers noted that sanders had been wearing these specific mittens for years slate caught up with the mitten maker herself jen ellis who lives in essex junction vermont in between teaching her class of second graders ellis explained what it was like to see her mittens at the inauguration how she came to give them to sanders and which memes are her favorites this interview has been condensed and edited for clarity advertisement advertisement advertisement rachelle hampton i m sure you re being flooded with so many interview requests right now jen ellis yeah i think my gmail has crashed now my report cards are due tomorrow so i need to focus on some other things until the weekend when this will probably not be a thing anymore what was your reaction when you saw bernie wearing your mittens at the inauguration i was totally delighted i was actually a little late to the game because i was remote teaching for the whole morning i go to my classroom and remote teach from my classroom i think it s important to just turn off all media and focus on your students but my phone happened to not be on mute and it started dinging in my coat pocket and i was like someone s really trying to reach me like maybe my parents are in danger advertisement as soon as i was done with my remote teaching i hopped in my car and drove home it was a huge blizzard yesterday up here in vermont so it took me forever as soon as i walked in the door my partner was like you re not going to believe this we don t watch tv we re intentionally a non tv family but we had taken the tv out of the closet so that our daughter could watch the inauguration we found our bunny ears and we found a local station that would allow us to watch the inauguration people had sent me pictures of bernie sanders sitting there in his chair looking a little grumpy then the camera zoomed right in on him and i was like there he is he s wearing my mittens i was completely surprised and delighted and flattered and good for him advertisement advertisement do you kind of wish he looked a bit less grumpy in this photo with your mittens that s now gone viral no i don t actually think he was grumpy i bet he was really excited to be there even though it was bittersweet right because he wanted to be in biden s shoes but i m sure he recognized the importance of that day and this whole change of power in america and i bet he was glad to be there he is who he is and not everyone has a resting pleasant face relatable speaking of bittersweet you supported bernie how did you feel about watching biden be sworn in as president oh my gosh i cried i m and i ve waited four decades of my life i m tearing up just thinking about it to see a woman be vice president i wish that she was president although i think biden is pretty great it was so powerful to sit there with my year old daughter who i love so much and be like this is where you enter politics right we have shielded you from trump as much as possible but this is what we want you to see a wonderful successful woman and a woman of color in such a powerful position it was great to share that with her and my partner who s also a woman so we re just a huge feminist household celebrating this momentous occasion advertisement advertisement and then there was this little side nagging thing of every five minutes i was getting several hundred more emails about the mittens a year ago when bernie was on the campaign trail he was wearing those mittens and twitter buzzed about it then i m not really on twitter i have an account but i don t really participate but a lot of my younger colleagues do and they were like you ve gotta check this out i went on twitter and what i saw was some misinformation that bothered me people were talking about how these mittens probably came from bernie s grandmother and they were a christmas gift and they were knitted there s so much inaccuracy in that bernie s jewish they were not a christmas gift advertisement so i put it out there that i made the mittens they were a gift and they re not knitted they re sewn from repurposed and up cycled sweaters at that time i had or mittens for sale and being a little na ve about twitter i put my gmail account on that which someone picked up yesterday and retweeted it people have been contacting me thinking that they can get mittens and actually they can t i don t have any more and i don t have much of a mitten business anymore because it really wasn t worth it independent crafters get really taken for a ride by the federal government we get taxed to the nth degree and it wasn t really worth it pursuing that as a business even as a side hustle i mostly just make them as gifts advertisement advertisement how did you come to give these mittens to bernie his daughter in law owns and operates a preschool down the street from my house and that s where we sent our daughter from the time she was months old i was making gifts for the preschool teachers and i knew liza was connected to bernie so i made an extra pair for him back when he lost the bid for the presidential nomination in to hillary clinton i was just sad because even though i like hillary i m also super pro bernie and as a public school teacher i can see every day how families are struggling people are just trying to make ends meet and they need things like student loan forgiveness and free education and a lot of the things that bernie is fighting for i sent him these mittens kind of as a shoutout to who he is and i put a note in that said something to the effect of i hope you run again advertisement tell me a bit more about how you make the mittens the outer layer is made out of discarded wool sweaters so wool sweaters that have moth holes or that someone sent through the washing machine or they were ripped or whatever fallen out of fashion i cut them up and i piece them together with other sweaters with complementary colors and i use the cuffs of the sweater to be the cuff of the mitten then i line them with fleece which is also a recycled material made out of plastic bottles shredded plastic i bought some thread at thrift stores i used all the thread from my grandmother s old sewing basket after she died and i find recyclable thread or reusable thread but usually i buy the thread advertisement advertisement advertisement do you have a favorite meme of bernie wearing your mittens there s one that s a rainbow and it has all the different fashion from yesterday and all the other people like red orange blue and purple are women and they re wearing fancy designer clothing and the green color of the rainbow is bernie i would just love to get that one framed and just have it because it features kamala harris and jill biden and amanda gorman all the heroes of yesterday were featured and then there s bernie there s another one it s just a picture of him sitting there by himself but the caption says i found my spot at tanglewood and i m not moving and tanglewood is an outdoor music venue in massachusetts and i love tanglewood i went to a little summer camp there when i was a kid so that one was especially funny advertisement honestly i think that my slice of media is so limited because people are making these as we speak and i m teaching reading lessons in a little rural vermont school with the snow gently falling i ve had to turn everything off so i can focus on what my real life is this is a really lovely flash in the pan but i know that it s not gonna last and i need to keep my day job people have sent me legitimate offers i ve only seen a few of them but people have been like oh i own a factory or oh i m a designer i m a businessperson i could publicize your new business i can see that if i wanted to drop everything and pursue that path i could do it but who knows how long that would last the path that i m already on brings me a tremendous amount of joy and i think that s the greatest symbol of success right this little blip of fame is sweet and it ll pass and then my regular life will just be what it already is which is kind of nice do you think you ll continue making mittens just to gift to people you know yeah i definitely will sometimes people approach me and their mother just died and their mother knitted one precious sweater for their child that never was worn and never fit and they ask me if i ll turn that into mittens because they want to keep it so in that sense i think i ll definitely keep making mittens for people,pos

i didn t feel safe mayor ben mcadams describes secret nights on street in shelter salt lake city for four months salt lake county mayor ben mcadams has kept a secret he s shared it with perhaps a handful of people in political circles but kept it out of headlines hoping to avoid the perception he said of a publicity stunt in the face of human suffering back in march just days before he was due by state law to select a third site for a new homeless resource center a decision he knew would anger thousands of his constituents regardless of his choice mcadams left work on a friday with no money or id and walked to salt lake city s most troubled neighborhood dressed in jeans sneakers and a hoodie the county mayor spent three days and two nights walking and sleeping among the homeless and drug addicted in salt lake city s rio grande neighborhood one night on the street one night in the shelter his experience was shocking on multiple levels he said and while he by no means meant his experience to be an expose on the road home shelter an important stakeholder in homeless services reform his stay did shed light on some troubling realities within the bed shelter including blatant use of drugs inside the men s dorms including his bunkmate injecting drugs into his arm though he declined to discuss details about that encounter with the deseret news he smelled what he assumed was smoke from drugs all night long he witnessed violence a fight between two men in the dorms during which a man was dragged off of his bunk and hit his head on the concrete floor he didn t feel safe and could see why someone would take their chances on the streets in degree rainy weather rather than spend a night in the downtown shelter the county mayor has kept his experience private for months but after the deseret news learned of the overnight stays from a source and requested an interview mcadams eventually reluctantly agreed to discuss it this week with the deseret news and salt lake tribune his reasoning for keeping it quiet he was worried it would appear as a cheap stunt to the press and public i was concerned that it not look like a publicity stunt in the face of human suffering the mayor said the purpose of the stay mcadams said was not to go undercover and expose the troubles homeless providers face while trying to serve utah s most vulnerable rather it was meant to help him deepen his understanding of the current homeless system before he decided which city would house a third homeless resource center at the time mcadams had endured nearly a month of heated public meetings and fury from residents in west valley city south salt lake and draper over the thought that their cities would house a homeless shelter though he and other homeless leaders have promised the new resource centers will be drastically different than the downtown emergency shelter mcadams said he felt something was missing from the hours of public input and even the more than two years he and his team have spent drafting a plan to reform the county s homeless services i needed to see firsthand to understand the complexity of the recommendation i was being asked to make he said the experience instilled in me a conviction that we had to move forward mcadams said during a time when many of his constituents were pushing back against years of effort to reform the homeless system there were many people saying back away and do nothing mcadams said seeing what i saw was shocking and i came away from this experience knowing we had to go forward we had to change the system that we as a community had kicked the can down the road for decades and just looked the other way inside the shelter after talking it over with his wife who was of course hesitant mcadams said he left his wallet behind at his county office at p m on friday march wearing a change of clothes he and a county employee who declined to be named for this story left on foot to the rio grande neighborhood he noted that he made an anonymous donation to a homeless providers account for the services he used on those two nights not disclosing who he was mcadams said he and his employee spent the first night on a street outside the rio grande area to understand why some people would choose not to go into shelter it was cold below s the mayor said when he woke up it was raining you wonder why people would choose to do that knowing that there were beds available in the shelter but the next night mcadams understood why the deseret news learned from two other people that after mcadams had checked into the men s dorms he saw his bunkmate injecting drugs into his arm when asked about that incident mcadams declined to discuss it i don t want to focus on my brief firsthand experience because i know there are people who see the same and worse every single day he explained the things i saw in my very brief time were shocking and reaffirmed my commitment to take action now but the mayor did say in general terms that he saw evidence of drug use including the presence of what he assumed was the smell of smoke from drugs all night long while he tried to sleep about feet away from his bunk mcadams also said an altercation broke out between two men one dragged the other off his bunk and his head hit the concrete people also warned him not to take off his shoes that they would be stolen if he did they also told him to use his bag as a pillow because if he didn t keep a close eye on his belongings they would be taken one person told me to be sure not to use the restroom at night because it wasn t safe mcadams added the man didn t elaborate but mcadams said he assumed it was a reference to sexual violence i didn t feel safe he said it was a fairly chaotic environment he added i certainly could understand why people would choose not to sleep there he said if he were addicted to drugs he would know the rio grande area is not the place to go to kick the habit adding that drug dealing is at every corner mcadams also said he was most troubled that children were exposed to such conditions he told about meeting a young family with a child diagnosed with mild autism the child was years old the same age of one of mcadams kids what psychological trauma is probably inflicted on a child who doesn t know where he s going to sleep or where his next meal is going to come from he asked it deepened in me a commitment that we ve got to do better for these kids in the months since mcadams visit the road home met its july deadline to have all families with children relocated out of the downtown shelter into housing or to the family shelter in midvale shelter challenges the road home has a no drugs policy inside its shelters matt minkevitch the road home shelter s executive director didn t know about mcadams stay until the deseret news informed him about it this week when told what the mayor had witnessed including the drug use and violence minkevitch called the events unfortunate and concerning he said the shelter has around the clock security that patrols the shelter and screens for drugs before clients are allowed in and the shelter has zero tolerance for violence we do our best to make sure that when we find somebody using drugs we escort them off the property minkevitch said and violent behavior is something we do not tolerate at all minkevitch after pulling incident files of that night march did find a report of an altercation that security responded to though it s not clear if it was the same fight that mcadams witnessed it s not uncommon for us to deal with people who are in the throes of addiction minkevitch said admitting that there have been incidents when drugs have been brought into the shelter there will always be a margin of error he said adding that even in secure environments like prisons people still find ways to sneak in drugs it s unfortunate that it s happening unfortunate that it s happening anywhere minkevitch said noting that the national opioid crisis has created a particularly challenging problem for homeless shelters across the country that night there were likely about men in the shelter a large number of people for one shelter to manage minkevitch said the shelters in utah are under so much stress right now noting that the road home s capacity has grown over the years to accommodate demand minkevitch said the correct combination of affordable housing and substance abuse and mental health treatment would help lift the burden off emergency shelters and help prevent the mixture of drugs and violence with people experiencing homelessness not an expose mcadams emphasized he didn t do this as an expose or to start a debate about the road home i get that there are a lot of providers who are trying really hard to do good work and i don t want my comments in any way to be an expose on them he said i think we have a lot of great service providers trying really hard under impossible circumstances to do what they think is right most of all mcadams said his experience reaffirms the conclusion leaders have reached that the current homeless model needs to change and that immediate actions need to be taken to improve public safety in and around the shelter minkevitch said he understands why mcadams would be compelled to spend a night in the shelter though it s not something he would encourage for the average person because it might mean the sacrifice of a bed for a person in need i respect the mayor for undertaking this in order to gain perspective to make an informed decision minkevitch said he faced a daunting task a very short window in order to make a very important decision mcadams said he walked away from the experience knowing that doing nothing is not an option even if it s the end of me politically he recalled a reporter asking him during a press conference the day he selected the south salt lake site whether he felt the situation has damaged his political career i almost broke down in tears mcadams said at the time he had paused before he answered with a smile yes i knew when i accepted this task that it would come with consequences for me personally he said but this work isn t about me personally it s about doing the right thing for people who are in crisis if i have to pay a personal price for moving this work forward it s a price i m willing to pay i ran for office to make a difference mcadams continued not to have a job this week mcadams stood by that answer saying i had a decision to protect myself or to take action to address this problem and it was one or the other woken up in the months since state leaders including gov gary herbert and lt gov spencer cox have joined house speaker greg hughes in addressing the lawlessness in the area a plan cox the state s point person has coined operation rio grande though the details of that plan have not been unveiled mcadams sat in on an hourslong meeting last week with state and city leaders to start coordinating an effort that mcadams said he s delighted to see coming to fruition one of my frustrations at the time was that i felt that i was alone he said political leaders for decades have kicked the can down the road and i knew that we had to do something speaker hughes to his credit was with me mcadams added but nobody else seemed to care hughes said he knew mcadams had stayed at the road home but agreed to keep it a secret at mcadams request hughes said mcadams experience opened my eyes and was absolutely an influencing factor in his motivation to step in over the past several months and push harder for better control of the lawlessness in the area it without a doubt informed my approach and my sence of urgency the speaker said it has provided invaluable information for me and has really informed my decision making process mcadams said he s ecstatic that the governor has finally woken up and realized they cannot sit on the sidelines any longer he just wishes it hadn t taken this long revamping the system he said can t happen fast enough the road home s downtown shelter is under a state mandated deadline to close in june when the three new homeless resource centers come

nasa says hole in the ozone smallest since its discovery in the hole in the ozone layer has shrunk to its smallest size since scientists began monitoring it in because of unusual weather patterns in the upper atmosphere over antarctica according to nasa the hole fluctuates in size annually and is usually largest during the coldest months in the southern hemisphere from late september to early october the latest observations from space have shown the hole now covers less than million square miles a record low and almost half as small as it was during its peak at million on september only six weeks ago experts say the hole is usually around million square miles during this time of year paul newman chief scientist for earth sciences at nasa s goddard space flight center said it is great news for ozone in the southern hemisphere but he warned it s important to recognize that what we re seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures it s not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery between september and october the hole shrunk to around million square miles million square kilometres the lowest size at which it has ever been recorded observations by nasa and noaa found that the hole reached its peak dimensions for the year at million square miles on september by early october the ozone hole can be seen to have shrunk to around million square miles the dobson unit can be seen on the left measuring the amount of a trace gas in a vertical column through the earth s atmosphere the hole in the ozone was at its largest in september when it covered a massive million square miles what is the ozone layer ozone is a molecule comprised of three oxygen atoms that occurs naturally in small amounts in the stratosphere roughly seven to miles above earth s surface the ozone layer acts like sunscreen shielding the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation it is produced in tropical latitudes and distributed around the globe closer to the ground ozone can also be created by photochemical reactions between the sun and pollution from vehicle emissions and other sources forming harmful smog in the s it was recognised that chemicals called cfcs used for example in refrigeration and aerosols were destroying ozone in the stratosphere in the montreal protocol was agreed which led to the phase out of cfcs and recently the first signs of recovery of the antarctic ozone layer at lower latitudes the upper stratosphere is also showing clear signs of recovery suggesting the montreal protocol is working well advertisement according to nasa the main ingredient in the ozone destroying process is are so called polar stratospheric clouds these relatively rare bodies occur high in the stratosphere at altitudes between feet metres above the surface these clouds provide a surface on which chemical reactions can occur releasing waste products called free radicals which go on to destroy ozone particles around them fewer polar stratospheric clouds form in warmer weather however and they also last for shorter periods of time in such conditions this year s warmer global temperatures aided by unusual weather patterns have therefore helped to limit the development of these clouds and also given those did form less time to damage the ozone layer in turn this has led to a much smaller ozone hole this year than we have previously seen on the surface the strengthening of the ozone layer would seem to be a promising development as such serves to better protect the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun however the news that the hole is shrinking is not necessarily a good sign as the process that is closing the hole is a clear product of rising global temperatures in years with more typical weather the hole usually reaches a maximum size of about million square miles by late september or early october before shrinking back down again gases released from man made processes on earth are eroding away the layer of ozone gas which surrounds the globe holes in the layer mean more heat from the sun makes it through and down to earth level which is warming the surface and oceans the highly reactive ozone molecule also known as trioxygen comprises three oxygen atoms and is a pale blue gas with a pungent smell it can be found miles above the earth s surface in the stratosphere by reacting with high energy ultraviolet rays the ozone acts like a layer of sun screen absorbing the harmful rays in the stratosphere before they reach earth s surface ozone is created primarily by ultraviolet radiation when high energy ultraviolet rays strike ordinary oxygen molecules o this splits the molecule into two single oxygen atoms dubbed atomic oxygen with the freed oxygen atoms going on to combine with regular oxygen molecules to form ozone o this reaction helps shield the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer cataracts suppress immune systems and also damage plants the ozone depletion seen in blue growing over the month of august pictured in august left and august the antarctic ozone hole which is technically not a hole but an area of depletion forms during the southern hemisphere s late winter as the returning sun s rays start ozone depleting reactions these runaway reactions involve chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from man made compounds and take place on the surfaces of cloud particles in cold stratospheric layers breaking up ozone molecules warmer temperatures mean fewer polar stratospheric clouds form limiting the ozone depletion that can take place on their surface nasa and noaa monitor the ozone hole using satellites including nasa s aura satellite the nasa noaa suomi national polar orbiting partnership satellite and noaa s joint polar satellite system noaa satellite at the south pole noaa staff launch weather balloons carrying ozone measuring sondes which directly sample ozone levels vertically through the atmosphere the flight path of an ozonesonde as it rises into the atmosphere over the south pole from the amundsen scott south pole station scientists release these balloon borne sensors to measure the thickness of the protective ozone layer high up in the atmosphere time lapse photo taken sept most years at least some levels of the stratosphere the region of the upper atmosphere where the largest amounts of ozone are normally found are completely devoid of ozone bryan johnson at noaa s earth system research laboratory in boulder colorado said this year ozonesonde measurements at the south pole did not show any portions of the atmosphere where ozone was completely depleted while this is uncommon it is not unprecedented this is the third time in the last years that weather systems have caused warm temperatures that limit ozone depletion said susan strahan an atmospheric scientist with universities space research association who works at nasa goddard the polar solar vortex seen in red over the south pole which was unusually wonky this year similar weather patterns in the antarctic stratosphere in september and also produced atypically small ozone holes she said dr strahan said it s a rare event that we re still trying to understand if the warming hadn t happened we d likely be looking at a much more typical ozone hole there is no identified connection between the occurrence of these unique patterns and changes in climate the weather systems that disrupted the ozone hole are typically modest in september but this year they were unusually strong dramatically warming the antarctic s stratosphere during the pivotal time for ozone destruction at an altitude of about miles kilometers temperatures during september were f c warmer than average the warmest in the year historical record for september by a wide margin in addition these weather systems also weakened the antarctic polar vortex knocking it off its normal center over the south pole and reducing the strong september jet stream around antarctica from a mean speed of miles per hour to a speed of miles per hour this slowing vortex rotation allowed air to sink in the lower stratosphere where ozone depletion occurs meaning the antarctic lower stratosphere was warmed limiting polar stratospheric clouds where the ozone destroying reactions take place the strong weather systems also brought ozone rich air from higher latitudes elsewhere in the southern hemisphere to the area above the antarctic ozone hole a combination of these two effects led to much higher than normal ozone levels over antarctica compared to ozone hole conditions usually present since the mid s as of october the ozone hole above antarctica remained small but stable and is expected to gradually dissipate in the coming weeks,pos
pope abolishes rule that kept church sex abuse cases top secret pope francis has issued an order removing the highest level of secrecy covering child sex abuse cases involving the clergy a move demanded by campaigners as part of sweeping changes to the way the catholic church deals with such allegations critics said the claim of pontifical secrecy was used by accused church officials to avoid cooperating with authorities the measures brought by the pope on tuesday change universal church law requiring the reporting of suspicions of sex abuse to civil authorities and forbidding attempts to silence those who report abuse or allege they have been a victim the pontiff decreed that information in abuse cases must still be protected by church leaders to ensure its security integrity and confidentiality but the vatican s leading sex crimes investigator archbishop charles scicluna called the reform an epochal decision that will allow for better coordination with police

legal marijuana cuts violence says us study as medical use laws see crime fall the introduction of medical marijuana laws has led to a sharp reduction in violent crime in us states that border mexico according to new research according to the study is legal pot crippling mexican drug trafficking organizations the effect of medical marijuana laws on us crime when a state on the mexican border legalised medical use of the drug violent crime fell by on average most of the marijuana consumed in the us originates in mexico where seven major cartels control the illicit drug trade these laws allow local farmers to grow marijuana that can then be sold to dispensaries where it is sold legally said the economist evelina gavrilova one of the study s authors these growers are in direct competition with mexican drug cartels that are smuggling the marijuana into the us as a result the cartels get much less business the knock on effect is a reduction in levels of drug related violence the cartels are in competition with one another gavrilova explained they compete for territory but it s also easy to steal product from the other cartels and sell it themselves so they fight for the product they also have to defend their territory and ensure there are no bystanders no witnesses to the activities of the cartel whenever there is a medical marijuana law we observe that crime at the border decreases because suddenly there is a lot less smuggling and a lot less violence associated with that while the mexican cartels smuggle other drugs such as cocaine heroine and metamphetamine across the border the market for marijuana is the largest drug market in the us and the one from which the cartels can make the fattest profit it costs around to produce a pound of marijuana in mexico which can then be sold on for depending on the quality gavrilova along with fellow researchers takuma kamada and floris zoutman studied data from the fbi s uniform crime reports and supplementary homicide records covering to they found that among the border states the effect of the change in law was largest in california where there was a reduction of in violent crime and weakest in arizona where there was a fall of the crimes most strongly affected were robbery which fell by and murder which dropped by homicides specifically related to the drug trade fell by an astonishing the authors claim their study provides new insights into methods to reduce violent crime related to drug trafficking but its publication comes as the us attorney general jeff sessions is rescinding the obama era policy that ushered in the medical marijuana laws when the effect on crime is so significant it s obviously better to regulate marijuana and allow people to pay taxes on it rather than make it illegal gavrilova said for me it s a no brainer that it should be legal and should be regulated and the proceeds go to the treasury more than states across the us have implemented medical marijuana laws so far in those that have there is now one marijuana dispensary for every six regular pharmacies the study suggests that the full legalisation of marijuana in colorado and washington will have an even stronger impact on the drug trade as large scale marijuana production facilities are erected in these states further threatening the position of drug cartels anecdotal evidence suggests the cartels are now trying to get into the legal marijuana business in california by opening their own farms others are turning to human trafficking and kidnapping to shore up their falling profits there are also reports that some cartels are switching to new forms of drug cultivation by growing poppies in mexico to produce their own heroin rather than importing it from afghanistan,pos

just one no vote from gonzales district councilwoman adriana rocha garcia was not present for either vote i just don t see how the ordinance really gets to the source of the problems that we have here

san antonio pet stores may soon be prohibited from selling dogs and cats provided by breeders animal care services conducted a survey in july and february of this year getting input from the public the council received written comments in support of the ordinance and against residents from animal rescue organizations and representatives of local pet stores spoke at thursday s council meeting all agreed they want to stop puppy mills but disagreed on how to achieve that petland vineyard owner david moreno said the ordinance would not have the intended effect of putting an end to bad breeders and would instead drive irresponsible breeders underground but rescue organizations noted roaming dogs and cats taken to city shelters are sometimes euthanized because of lack of space and that requiring pet stores to sell rescued dogs and cats would give another outlet for those animals to find homes we do not have a shortage of dogs and puppies said julianne marchbanks founder of god s dogs rescue residents can still purchase purebred dogs and cats from private licensed breeders under the changes approved thursday all dogs and cats sold by pet stores in san antonio must be

universal city stopped selling dogs and cats from breeders in instead it acquires rescues from animal care services and has sold nearly rescue puppies according to owner randy housely animal care services director heber lefgren said that even good pet stores who are wanting to do the right things oftentimes find themselves along the way realizing that they have been dealing with some of the bad actors many breeders are licensed by the u s department of agriculture but lefgren said these standards are minimal usda breeders he said are allowed to confine a dog into a cage for its life that is inches more than the size of the pet district councilman manny pal ez said that this policy can better foster the adoption of animals in our community diminish the amount of stray animals in our neighborhoods and potentially increase our already high live release rate it is critical to note that commercial operations that sell cats and dogs can continue the practice he said only now they will do so by sourcing from shelters and rescue organizations instead of fueling an industry that too often overlooks animal welfare in the pursuit of profit opponents of the ordinance argued that these pet stores offer residents the ability to choose a pet that is the best fit for their specific needs others said rescue organizations are too stringent even biased in making adoption decisions albert sardinas of seattle who was at the council meeting thursday representing puppyland said he sought a husky as an emotional support animal for his daughter he said shelter staff in seattle wouldn t approve the adoption because they deemed her circumstances not good enough prohibiting pet stores from only selling animals sourced from rescues is not going to fix san antonio s stray animal problem

andrews sullivan said it was very difficult to adopt an animal until my kids were just given one we know families that are marginalized have not really been able to step up to adopt because they may

outdoor rec just got its own stimulus bill earlier today the senate passed the great american outdoors act allocating billions to support outdoor recreation in two separate ways the first is by providing billion over the next five years to help the national park service and other federal land management agencies address their maintenance backlogs federal public lands are suffering from billion in deferred maintenance costs with billion of that accumulated by the national park service the second is to mandate that the land and water conservation fund lwcf widely considered the nation s single best funding tool for outdoor recreation be permanently financed to its maximum allotment of million annually in march the president called for such a bill to land on his desk it s a remarkable breakthrough at a time when the white house has been hostile to federal conservation and land management agencies and to the lwcf trump s proposed budget slashed the park service budget by million and allocated just million to the lwcf a mere percent of its allotment the bill passed by a vote of to proponents including the bill s sponsor republican cory gardner of colorado tout the great american outdoors act as a way to get people back to work after millions have been laid off in the wake of the covid pandemic years of bipartisan work have led to this moment and this historic opportunity for conservation says gardner today the senate passed not only the single greatest conservation achievement in generations but also a lifeline to mountain towns and recreation communities hit hard by the covid pandemic a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced their version of the legislation in the house of representatives on june and passage of that version is expected in the coming weeks clearing the way for the president to sign the bill into law we are going to have to rebuild the economy and this can be a really big part of that says democratic senator martin heinrich of new mexico noting that nationally outdoor recreation contributes billion in consumer spending and supports million jobs yet our trails and campgrounds aren t in the shape that they should be which directly impacts economic activity on public lands and in gateway communities in may more than signatories representing conservation organizations local governments and state and regional tourism boards urged congressional leaders to support the bill the great american outdoors act will ensure a future for nature to thrive kids to play and hunters and anglers to enjoy they wrote established in the lwcf has funded some billion in land acquisitions and facilities constructions over time ranging from expanding national parks to building bike paths baseball diamonds and boat ramps every single county in the nation has had a project aided by the lwcf yet it has been funded to its maximum million annual allotment only twice in its history and generally averages about million a year conservationists have been working for decades to guarantee that the lwcf which is paid for out of offshore oil and gas drilling royalties be fully and permanently funded rather than have the remainder siphoned off to other government programs the portion of the bill that funds maintenance backlogs on federal public lands was originally floated by trump administration officials the idea was to help pay down the national park service s billion maintenance backlog with oil and gas royalties from public lands and was written into the restore our parks act when that bill was bundled with lwcf funding efforts to create the great american outdoors act maintenance backlog funding was expanded to include the u s forest service u s fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management in addition to the bureau of indian education seventy percent of the billion would go to the park service percent to the forest service and percent to each of the other agencies conservationists welcome the expanded bill the forest service alone has a billion maintenance backlog on trails campgrounds and other facilities notes adam cramer executive director of the outdoor alliance a coalition of outdoor recreation advocacy groups our national parks are our country s crown jewels cramer says but the rest of our national public lands are what make up the actual crown the amount and diversity of outdoor recreation opportunities including hunting and fishing on our national forests blm lands and wildlife refuges is staggeringly huge for many conservationists the great american outdoors act has been a lightning bolt out of the blue sparked by a tweet from president trump i m calling on congress to send me a bill that fully and permanently funds the lwcf and restores our national parks he tweeted on march he went on to give credit to two republican senators colorado s gardner and montana s steve daines both of whom had visited the president in the oval office on february to urge support for the bill many have commented on the fact that both gardner and daines are facing tough reelection campaigns in states where constituents prize outdoor recreation daines is tied with his democratic opponent and gardner trails his opponent in the most recent polls at the time democratic senator maria cantwell of washington state a longtime lwcf supporter wryly called the bill s emergence a miracle lately there has been bipartisan support for conservation measures last year the john d dingell jr conservation management and recreation act which created six new national park service units and million acres of wilderness passed the senate by a vote of to public lands and waters are one of the things that are capable of bringing all americans together new mexico s heinrich says i see the economic benefits of public lands being talked about vigorously in smaller communities in this cycle heinrich lauds republican senators lamar alexander of tennessee and rob portman of ohio in addition to gardner and daines with being tireless champions of the great american outdoors act which he says was named to appeal to the white house heinrich who most observers credit with driving the effort to expand maintenance funding beyond the park service explains that while the bureau of indian education doesn t have a recreation mission it was included in the bill because by historical accident the agency was placed in the department of the interior and therefore he says time and again their funding levels get left out sometimes you have to deal with the history that puts us where we are politics aside the bill stands to benefit every american especially now we are seeing during the pandemic how important walking outside is to people s well being says heinrich right now more than kids in this country don t have a park within a ten minute walk of their house he says noting that the lwcf can remedy that the rebuilding can be as equitable as we want it to be,pos

birmingham college student walked miles to st day of work so his boss gave him his car when a young birmingham college student s car broke down the night before he was supposed to start a new job he didn t panic at least not for long instead walter carr walked from homewood to pelham all night in the dark miles or more a carver high school graduate and u s marine hopeful carr walked throughout the early morning hours friday because he needed and wanted the job with bellhops moving company he made it to hoover by a m and then to pelham at a m it was in pelham that the trek took a surprising turn kindness and concern from four pelham police officers coupled with publicly posted words of amazement and admiration from the moving company s clients about carr s work ethic and dedication led to a massive pat on the back monday from bellhops ceo luke marklin marklin drove in from tennessee under the guise of meeting carr for coffee to personally thank him that meeting ended with marklin surprising carr by giving carr his own barely driven ford escape i am honestly blown away by him marklin said of carr everything he did that day is exactly who we are heart and grit so far he s batting an emotional carr had just one word when marklin handed him the keys seriously all the accolades over the weekend started with a post from jenny lamey on facebook she wrote that she and her husband chris got up about a m friday to get everything staged and ready for the movers about a m their doorbell rang and the lameys found pelham police officers at their door he proceeded to tell us that he had picked up this nice kid in pelham early this morning the nice kid walter said that he was supposed to help us with our move today it was his first day on the job with this moving company bellhops and he was training today jenny lamey wrote saturday night the officer then told the lameys about carr s perseverance in getting to work he walked all night to get from homewood to pelham because he needed to get to work for those reading this that are not local that s over miles you could tell how the officer told us this story that he had complete admiration for walter and by my reaction he could tell i did too she wrote the police officer said they picked him up earlier that morning took him to get some breakfast and once they checked his story out brought walter to our house jenny lamey said carr was welcome to stay until the rest of the bellhops crew arrived and even offered him the chance to go upstairs and take a nap until then he declined and said he could go ahead and get started so he began alongside the lameys until the crews got there we chatted while we were working together early yesterday morning he loved my kitchen and said that it was exactly the kind of kitchen he would want he was from new orleans he and his mother lost their home in hurricane katrina and they came and made their home in birmingham she wrote i asked him if he was tired from all that walking and he said replied that he wasn t and that he had a hour nap before he left at midnight he said he made it to hoover around a m and then to pelham around am that s about when the officer picked him up and took him to get breakfast he wore black nike joggers which he commented that he intentionally wore because he knew he had to walk thru sic some pretty high grass on his middle of the night trek she wrote he looked at me in the eye and smiled and i felt like i had known him much longer jenny lamey also praised the rest of the moving crew but it was clear carr left an impression on her she has set up a gofundme account to help him out i just can t tell you how touched i was by walter and his journey he is humble and kind and cheerful and he had big dreams he is hardworking and tough i can t imagine how many times on that lonely walk down in the middle of the night did he want to turn back she wrote how many times did he wonder if this was the best idea how many times did he want to find a place to sit or lie down and wait til morning when he could maybe get someone to come pick him up and bring him back home but he walked until he got here i am in total awe of this young man she said she made carr tell his co workers of his ordeal walter said i walked that was it humble i asked him to share a little more and when he did the crew was in awe of him too she wrote i don t know that walter would have shared if i hadn t asked him to she ended her post with this so yes yesterday we moved yesterday was crazy yesterday was long and hard and hot but walter pelham police officer mark knighten was the first to encounter walter that morning because it was a m and he was walking on the side of the roadway knighten stopped to ask carr if everything was ok carr explained to him that he was walking to work and why and knighten took action he was very polite it was yes sir and no sir knighten said knighten along with officers klint rhodes and carl perkinson then took carr to whataburger where they not only bought him breakfast but told him to get lunch to go as well because it was still so early knighten said they took carr to a church because that was the safest place to leave him until it was time for him to be at work officer scott duffey was just coming on the clock and his fellow officers told them about their morning duffey then went in search of carr who had already left the church to walk to his job assignment which was almost in chelsea duffey picked him and drove him to the lamey s house where he knocked on the door and explained the situation carr plans to graduate from lawson state in december with an associate s degree in health sciences he wants to join the u s marines and then come back to birmingham to get his bachelor s degree in physical therapy carr said he is so thankful for all who stepped in this was the first job in a long time to give me an opportunity to get hired he said i wanted to show them i got the dedication i said i m going to get to this job one way or another i want people to know this no matter what the challenge is you can break through the challenge nothing is impossible unless you make it impossible he said you can do anything you set your mind to i ve got god by my side i m really emotional right now trying to hold back the tears carr said his mother and father raised him to help others and he plans to use his new car to do just that to my parents thank you for being there for me for the hard work and dedication they put in to keep me on the right path he said and i want to thank god because without him i wouldn t be here god blessed me to be a blessing he said whatever challenges god puts in front of me i know its for a reason jenny lamey also was emotional on monday she hugged carr tightly and told him this you ve changed all of our lives walter you have no idea how many lives you ve changed and inspired you re a very special young man and you re going to

the koreans who cheer for canada and china and russia and japan pyeongchang south korea it wasn t long after the air canada flight containing tessa virtue and scott moir touched down at south korea s largest airport that the canadian figure skating duo was greeted by a loud and happy throng who were those people waving canadian flags and cheering with a patriotic fervour that suggested they carried passports bearing the national maple leaf most of them were not canadians some were members of the korean supporters a group of korean volunteers who plan to devote their olympics to an unusual mission cheering for countries other than their own everyone else in korea is going to support korea we re trying to focus on other countries said ki yang cho head of communications for the korean supporters speaking through a translator ki said the group which has about registered members has been bringing about volunteers to seoul s incheon airport most days this week to happily fete olympic athletes and tourists as they take their first steps on korean soil they ve created an assembly line of all nations goodwill shortly after virtue and moir had their moment earlier this week members of russia s men s hockey team emerged to a similarly boisterous welcome once the games begin there are plans to assign squads of about to korean supporters to each olympic event the supporters buy their own tickets and are encouraged to cheer in the native tongue of the athletes they re tasked with supporting we re cheering in russian english chinese japanese said ki we re going to have chants we re going to call out phrases we re going to wave flags possibly even the flag of north korea which is normally illegal to display here given the nuclear standoff induced tensions between the neighbours with north korea having arrived at the games with a small contingent of athletes not to mention a strong cheer squad meant to root for athletes from both koreas the korean supporters do not plan to let old grudges ruin the spirit of their cause we re not going to treat the north koreans as special we re going to support them like we do other nations said ki the organization was founded by businessman moon sang ju in the lead up to the world cup of soccer co hosted by south korea and japan moon s idea at the time he said was to help improve his country s global image and to promote world peace the entire world is one family even if we re from different countries said moon also speaking through a translator it s just sports it s okay to support other countries and other athletes the strong korean supporters group is dedicated to cheering for athletes from other countries that view hasn t always been received with universal agreement in korea which harbours a sports culture which encourages boisterous and elaborate cheering for the home team albeit without the violent hooliganism that sometimes mars the endeavour elsewhere during a world cup soccer game in between korea and poland in busan korea s second most populous city the korean supporters enlisted a squad of about volunteers to cheer for poland the story goes that many of the volunteers were swept up in the moment and ended up cheering for their homeland instead when korea won igniting a memorable run to the world cup semifinal nationalistic sentiment soared there definitely were times when people actually said we should only cheer for korea said moon when that happened i tried to explain to people our mission some of those people became part of this organization and now they re cheering for other nations with us the official tagline of the olympics goes passion connected for the korean supporters it s more like passion practised the group has its own song and its own dance it has its own uniform an eye catching yellow vest and ki acknowledged that it even has its imitators other groups also plan to cheer for visiting nations at these olympics although he said he didn t know much about them the supporters pursuit also comes with its challenges ki said it isn t difficult to find volunteers to cheer for athletes from other countries at popular marquee events like say figure skating where virtue and moir canada s flag bearers at friday s opening ceremony will look to expand an olympic medal collection that already includes a gold and two silvers that s why the korean supporters have been focusing their efforts on encouraging members to attend less glamorous events held outdoors say cross country skiing and biathlon with temperatures expected to plummet well below freezing during the games it s been a tall order because of the cold weather it s very hard to make volunteers go to some of those events but my plan is to have to volunteers at each event said ki loading loading loading loading loading loading moon the group s founder said the sub zero temperatures at what s expected to be one of the coldest olympics in history only make his group s noble mission more necessary in a geopolitical hot spot the idea is to warm hearts in the cold weather being cheered is a very good thing it makes you happy said moon there are a lot of people in the world worrying about nuclear war in this korean peninsula so we re thankful to the athletes and tourists for coming to korea that s what motivates us to support canadians and athletes from all over the world we re trying to promote a world where there is no war winter olympics playlist,pos

zero elephants poached in a year in top africa wildlife park zero elephants found killed by poachers in a year in one of africa s largest wildlife reserves johannesburg one of africa s largest wildlife preserves is marking a year without a single elephant found killed by poachers which experts call an extraordinary development in an area larger than switzerland where thousands of the animals have been slaughtered in recent years the apparent turnaround in niassa reserve in a remote region of northern mozambique comes after the introduction of a rapid intervention police force and more assertive patrolling and response by air according to the new york based wildlife conservation society which manages the reserve with mozambique s government and several other partners monitoring of the vast reserve with aerial surveys and foot patrols remains incomplete and relies on sampling however and despite the sign of progress it could take many years for niassa s elephant population to rebuild to its former levels even if poaching is kept under control aggressive poaching over the years had cut the number of niassa s elephants from about to little over in according to an aerial survey anti poaching strategies from to reduced the number killed but the conservation group called the rate still far too high the new interventions with mozambican president felipe nyusi personally authorizing the rapid intervention force have led partners to hope that niassa s elephants stand a genuine chance for recovery the conservation group said it is a remarkable achievement james bampton country director with the wildlife conservation society told the associated press he said he discovered the year free of poaching deaths while going through data the last time an elephant in the niassa reserve was recorded killed by a poacher was may he said political will is a key reason for the success bampton said with mozambique s president keen to see poaching reduced bampton acknowledged that the low number of remaining elephants is also a factor in the decline in poaching a year ago he estimated that fewer than elephants remained in niassa though he now says preliminary analysis of data from a survey conducted in october and not yet published indicated that about elephants are in the reserve still a year that appears to be free of elephant poaching in the sprawling reserve drew exclamations from some wildlife experts it is a major and very important development that poaching has ceased this represents a major success george wittemyer who chairs the scientific board for the kenya based organization save the elephants told the ap the new rapid intervention police force is an elite unit that is better armed than the reserve s normal rangers and has a bit of a reputation of being quite hard bampton said adding that no bad incidents have been reported in niassa members of the force are empowered to arrest suspected poachers put together a case within hours and submit it to the local prosecutor bampton said just being caught with a firearm is considered intent to illegal hunting with a maximum prison sentence of years wildlife experts have seen gains elsewhere in africa against elephant poaching tanzania s selous game reserve widely acknowledged as ground zero for poaching and linked to the niassa reserve by a wildlife corridor also has seen a recent decline in the killings african elephant poaching has declined to pre levels after reaching a peak in according to the convention on international trade in endangered species but experts say the rate of annual elephant losses still exceeds the birth rate and the encroachment of human settlements is reducing the animals range africa s elephant population has plummeted from an estimated several million around to at least according to surveys in recent years collaboration and huge effort among the niassa reserve s partners has been crucial but data show that issues remain with other iconic species such as lions said rob harris country manager for fauna flora international which supports one of the operators in the reserve so the combination of national level support and on the ground effort must be maintained to improve the situation for all wildlife associated press writer christopher torchia contributed follow africa news at https twitter com ap africa,pos

leading to irreversible paralysis death can occur when breathing muscles are affected twenty five years ago thousands of children in africa were paralysed by the virus the disease is now only found in afghanistan and pakistan there is no cure but the polio vaccine protects children for life nigeria is the last african country to be declared free from wild polio having accounted for more than half of all global cases less than a decade ago the vaccination campaign in nigeria involved a huge effort to reach remote and dangerous places under threat from militant violence and some health workers were killed in the process what is polio and has it now been eradicated in africa polio is a virus which spreads from person to person usually through contaminated water it can lead to paralysis by attacking the nervous system two out of three strains of wild polio virus have been eradicated worldwide on tuesday africa has been declared free of the last remaining strain of wild poliovirus more than of africa s population has now been immunised this was one of the conditions that the africa regional certification commission set before declaring the continent free from wild polio now only the vaccine derived polio virus remains in africa with cases being identified this year this is a rare form of the virus that mutates from the oral polio vaccine and can then spread to under immunised communities the world health organization who has identified a number of these cases in nigeria the democratic republic of the congo central african republic and angola how did africa eliminate wild

country was affected that year nelson mandela launched the kick polio out of africa programme mobilising millions of health workers who went village to village to hand deliver vaccines it was backed by a coalition of groups including rotary international which had spearheaded the polio vaccination drive from the s since billions of oral polio vaccines have been provided averting an estimated million cases of wild poliovirus what have the challenges been the last communities at risk of polio live in some of the most complicated places to deliver immunisation campaigns nigeria is the last country in africa to have reported a case of wild polio in borno state in nigeria s remote north east and the epicentre of the boko haram insurrection in at the time it was a frustrating set back as the country had made huge progress and had gone two years without any cases being identified outside nigeria the last place to have seen a case of polio was in the puntland region of somalia in conflict with the islamist militant group boko haram has made parts of nigeria particularly difficult to reach borno state in particular more than two million people have been displaced by the fighting frontline workers of whom were women managed to navigate areas of conflict like lake chad by boat and deliver vaccines to remote communities widespread rumours and misinformation about the vaccine have also slowed down immunisation efforts in kano and a number of other northern states suspended immunisations following reports by muslim religious leaders that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti fertility agent as part of an american plot to make muslim women infertile laboratory tests by nigerian scientists dismissed the accusations vaccine campaigns resumed the following year but the rumours persisted in nine female polio vaccinators were killed in two shootings thought to be carried out by boko haram at health centres in kano it has taken decades to achieve eradication and overcome suspicion around the vaccine how polio survivors made a difference winning the trust of communities has been key misbahu lawan didi president of the nigerian polio survivors association says that the role of survivors has been crucial in persuading people to accept the campaign image caption misbahu lawan didi has worked hard to persuade sceptical parents to allow their children to have the vaccine many rejected the polio vaccine but they see how much we struggle to reach them sometimes crawling large distances to speak to them we ask them don t you think it is important for you to protect your child not to be like us from polio survivors to traditional and religious leaders school teachers parents volunteers and health workers a huge coalition developed to defeat polio working together they travelled to remote communities to immunise children how serious is polio polio or poliomyelitis mainly affects children aged under five initial symptoms include fever fatigue headache vomiting stiffness of the neck and pains in the limbs it also invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours one in infections leads to irreversible paralysis among those paralysed to of people die when their breathing muscles become immobilised could wild polio return polio can be easily imported into a country that is polio free and from there it can spread rapidly among under immunised populations this happened in angola which despite decades of civil war defeated polio in the country remained free from polio for four years until when a number of cases were thought to have been brought in from outside the country the who says that it is important countries remain vigilant and avoid complacency until there is global eradication if they let down their defence by failing to vaccinate then wild polio could once again begin to spread quickly for all types of polio to be eliminated including vaccine derived polio vaccination efforts will need to

to get out of there during tangie s pregnancy doctors discovered a tiny amniotic membrane had wrapped around shaquem s hand it s a thin tissue you can barely see tangie said the doctor answered the

tough until i had my fingers removed but after that i knew i was going to play again the pain was gone it didn t hurt when the ball hit shaquem and shaquill older by seconds formed an even deeper bond

schwarzenegger shortsighted for california to defund pandemic stockpile he built former ca governor arnold schwarzenegger delivers a cargo of n masks in los angeles daniel ketchell schwarzenegger shortsighted for california to defund pandemic stockpile he built oakland former gov arnold schwarzenegger told politico on tuesday it was shortsighted for california leaders to abandon a million emergency preparedness effort he initiated in to deal with a future pandemic as the state now scrambles to prepare for a surge in coronavirus cases when the state budget swelled years ago schwarzenegger launched a surge capacity stockpile that included mobile hospitals and medical gear intended to prepare california for a situation like it is facing today with the state facing a billion deficit in gov jerry brown and state lawmakers withdrew funding to maintain the supplies according to an investigative report last week by reveal and the los angeles times as public servants our ultimate responsibility is not just to make a budget balance but to save lives schwarzenegger responded for the first time tuesday in a phone interview he said that when the bird flu emerged in he was deeply concerned about having sufficient supplies in california to handle potential disasters like infectious disease outbreaks and major earthquakes that could kill hundreds of thousands i thought we have to be prepared because we are the fifth largest economy in the world he said the former governor on tuesday never specifically mentioned or criticized brown his successor yes there was a budget crunch it s easy for them to just look at the numbers but not really to visualize disaster schwarzenegger said of the cuts which eviscerated the emergency medical program they obviously made their judgments to take those expenditures out and to worry about a few million dollars would i have done it no schwarzenegger said but i understand that every governor and every administration looks at those things differently schwarzenegger spoke to politico after a trip to los angeles hospitals tuesday where he personally delivered a cargo of masks to doctors on the front lines of the pandemic a move to underscore his support of the frontline responders fund the former governor has donated million to the gofundme effort to raise money for desperately needed equipment during the covid crisis the cause which has raised million to date has also been backed by twitter s jack dorsey angel investor ron conway and hollywood luminaries like edward norton the equipment was procured by the bay area based logistics firm flexport which last week delivered surgical masks gloves surgical gowns and thermometers to san francisco s department of public health techcrunch reported schwarzenegger asked about president donald trump s performance during the pandemic declined to criticize him saying the first goal is to to tackle the pandemic but he allowed that the federal government has not been as quick in their response as they could have been the thing is did you learn from your mistakes he said and did you admit your weaknesses because the way you improve is by just acknowledging ok you know this is a screw up or i made a mistake there and to say this would never happen again schwarzenegger said he has also been in regular touch with california gov gavin newsom whom he gave high marks for the pandemic response especially he said newsom s early order to shelter in place which may have saved lives i think that he did a terrific job to be on top of it and to stay on top of it he said whatever he needs me to do i ll do i want to support him but schwarzenegger who has been posting daily messages on twitter about staying healthy and engaged during the pandemic warned that now it s critical that californians must act on their own volunteer or give to causes that will help give doctors what they need at this critical time california residents must recognize that government can only do so much he said at the end of the day it goes back to people power and we the people have the power to do our share and just stay home,pos

what the world s most famous amateur can teach pro runners photo credit alexander hassenstein getty at just years old yuki kawauchi is in a distance running category of his own as of january he has run the most sub marathons of anyone ever he s also run the most sub marathons of anyone ever kawauchi one guy has run more sub marathons since than the whole united states put together kawauchi s best time for was two seconds faster than the fastest marathon of the year by any u s man which would be galen rupp who ran a career best of in chicago rupp like most athletes at that level ran two marathons in kawauchi ran advertisement his singularity continues distance running at the top levels is dominated by east africans he s japanese most elite marathoners train with a group and a coach with corporate sponsorship that allows them to train full time they run twice a day spend time at altitude and have access to the latest equipment nutrition and sport science kawauchi has neither coach nor training group nor corporate sponsorship he fits once a day workouts around his full time government job he made his own home gym and is more likely to look at the methods of great runners of the past than the training philosophy du jour he s wildly popular in japan and is one of the few distance runners anywhere with a truly global fan base critics point to his relatively poor performances in big races world championships and world marathon majors and the fact that his personal best of is more than five minutes off the world record not even close to the top performances all time but the fact that this one guy has run consistently faster times than all u s marathoners combined without all their resources and seems to be having a grand time doing it makes him worth listening to in march ayano onodera an editor with japanese media company sportsnavi published kawauchi s extensive views on training and racing and the future of japanese running the three part essay was translated by editor of the english language blog japan running news brett larner though it was not meant to be didactic u s distance runners might at least be inspired to think differently about their pursuit as kawauchi said that s why i want to show all the athletes at the powerful running schools in japan who like me in those days are frustrated and injured there s another world out there another way by doing that i hope to give them the chance to feel again the love of the run g o media may get a commission exclusive for new customers caliper cbd at caliper use the promo code kinjaten with that in mind here are the most actionable takeaways from kawauchi s interview incorporating jogging most top american runners would never on god s earth use the term jogging to describe any part of their training but kawauchi loves it there are those who look at that kind of ultra long distance jogging and say running slowly is meaningless no matter how much you do but i think the people who make that kind of criticism have probably never done it themselves if you actually experience the feeling you get after about three hours the i can endure this fatigue in my legs but if i lose it mentally i ll immediately want to quit one that s similar to the light headed sensation at the end of the marathon the numbness of hands and feet and loss of concentration that come after that the feeling that your stamina is evaporating from the core of your body and the overpowering sense of euphoria you get after going over the wall i don t think you can call it meaningless the confidence that is built by doing ultra long distance jogging the knowledge in the second half when things are getting tough that i ve run km and km so i know for sure that my stamina isn t going to break in the second half the internationals running next to me haven t done km so i know that my legs are the ones that are still going to keep moving when things get down and dirty has really helped a person like me who tends to get discouraged easily advertisement once a day training kawauchi trains once a day mostly out of necessity since he works a full time job most pro runners on all continents run twice a day racking up mega miles which increase chances of injury for someone who only trains once a day like i have ever since i was at gakushuin university i feel that adding ultra long distance jogging trail runs on my days off has been effective in improving my physical and mental ability to hold it together in the second half of the marathon however since the runners on many teams are obligated to do group morning runs in addition to their regular training sessions in terms of both the time and physical demands i think it would be hard for them to add the same kind of ultra long distance jogging that i have by doing morning runs every day they usually exceed km a month but in my case i m typically averaging about km a month when you consider that runners belonging to teams are doing km a day on average in their morning runs my monthly mileage is going to be at least km less since i don t do them that means a physical margin of over km a year compared to other athletes and i think that s why ultra long distance jogging has had such a major impact on me conversely if someone who is already doing over km a month kept doing their morning runs and tried to add ultra long distance jogging to that i think they would destroy their legs with stress fractures and whatnot old school marathoners might get mad and say it s a soft way of thinking but i m pretty sure the human body has a mileage limit working within that limit i think all you can do is choose between doing multiple short runs or longer single runs advertisement being globally competitive u s and japanese distance runners are both struggling to be competitive in a sport dominated by east africans the goals and thought processes of runners in both countries are quite similar kawauchi offers the idea that marathoners can be competitive without running a marathon the number of them japanese runners who say my goal is to win a medal at the olympics is very large the number who say my goal is to set a world record is vanishingly small and i ve pretty much never met anyone who says my goal is to compete in international marathons all around the world the sole reason most frequently cited for why japanese athletes can t compete with the world is concept in other words the point of view that even though the world is running and japan still can t even break the national record i have to wonder whether the people who voice that opinion are aware that only one person has ever run once and that in terms of sub even including the record ineligible boston you are talking about ten people on just five courses berlin chicago london frankfurt and boston there s nothing better than being fast for being competitive but there s an element of being competitive that you can t learn just from being fast for example abel kirui kenya gold medalist in berlin and daegu world championships has a pb but that s not something he has done multiple times even though he has run a lot of marathons his second best time is over seconds slower than the japanese national record both uganda s stephen kiprotich london olympics and moscow world championships gold medalist and eritrea s ghirmay ghebreslassie beijing world championships gold medalist also have pbs slower than the japanese national record following that line of thinking i think it s impossible to say that japan s inability for many years to win medals at the olympics and world championships is exclusively due to a time gap advertisement medaling or getting on the podium is not about running world record pace for miles but running world record pace for two or three miles late in the race championship style races i e those without pacemakers in which runners are competing for a place rather than a time are often won in or though the field is loaded with speedsters the podium spots are taken by runners who best weathered a couple fast miles between and and slowed the least after that while he admits he hasn t mastered it kawauchi says the key to medaling is late race surges i ve always thought that in order to win medals the element that japanese people must foster is the more intangible although evident if you look at mid race split times ability to handle small pace changes mid race and surge battles late in the race in the last few years a considerable number of japanese athletes have run times of or however the only one who has been able to respond to a surge after km and run a km split of at that point in the race was kazuhiro maeda at the rio olympics the american galen rupp won the bronze medal and since he was also a speed runner with track achievements including a silver in the london olympics m there are now more people saying that just goes to show that japanese people also need minute level speed in order to be competitive in the marathon however the reality is that although rupp ran from to km for the next km after that he slowed down to losing a lot of ground to eventual winner eliud kipchoge kenya in other words if you could cover the km after km in like maeda then at km you would only be seconds behind rupp in the rio olympics if you could then run within instead of the rupp ran for the next km after km you d be in the race for a medal advertisement running marathons is okay for young guns if they approach it with a veteran s sense of humility and patience the conventional wisdom is that speed has an expiration date so young talented distance runners are counseled to stick with the short stuff k and k it s thought marathon training will kill your speed so most top runners are around years old when they run their first marathon kawauchi thinks it s fine to apply the strength and speed of youth to the marathon but cautions to check the youthful ego and impatience you don t want to die and taste the torments of hell to suffer injury and trauma that will destroy your self confidence i think it s a good trend that young athletes are gaining awareness of the marathon while they have physical strength and speed in my own experience i learned many things from the two marathons i ran while attending gakushuin university if you don t actually run the marathon there s a lot you can t understand just by armchair theorizing but as the number of young athletes taking on the marathon increases in this way in the buildup to the tokyo olympics there are two things to be concerned about the first is that too many athletes have goals that are too high for their first marathons if the goal is ultimately to run or i think that instead of saying let s rock the marathon right from the first time and jumping in only to die and taste the torments of hell to suffer injury and trauma that will destroy your self confidence saying who cares what time you run in your debut i want to be able to achieve my goal in the end and holding back to run at a pace that suits you will let you finish thinking marathons are fun and let you run later marathons in a positive state of mind,pos

coronavirus pandemic according to a new study by the nonprofit action on smoking and health almost half said it was a direct response to heightened health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic the study also found that older people are quitting at slower rates than younger people despite being categorized in the more vulnerable group i don t want to be one of those people in a ward with an oxygen mask over my face struggling to tell my loved ones what i m feeling one recent quitter told business insider visit business insider s homepage for more stories before the coronavirus pandemic hit saurav dutt smoked up to six cigarettes a day the year old author from london first took up the habit as a way to unwind from college exams but as the years went by he found that it helped him focus and it became essential to his writing process smoking inspires my writing and drives me out of dark moods when i hit writer blocks or doubt my efforts dutt told business insider but as covid gripped the world dutt who had tried quitting in the past but never managed to do so decided it was finally time to give up so after years of smoking he quit i don t want to be one of those people in a ward with an oxygen mask over my face struggling to tell my loved ones what i m feeling dutt said covid has brought the issue of personal health into focus for me like never before he is not alone according to a recent survey by the uk charity action on smoking and health ash conducted between april to june more than one million people in britain have given up smoking of those poeple almost half said it was a direct response to heightened health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic the study added covid the disease caused by the coronavirus has so far killed more than people worldwide their reaction is understandable covid is known to attack the respiratory system first with symptoms including a bad cough and shortness of breath smokers may have higher risk of getting severe coronavirus symptoms in the last few months researchers have been trying to find out how strong the link between smokers and severe coronavirus cases really is a recent study by the society for research on nicotine and tobacco found that smokers are nearly twice as likely to develop severe coronavirus symptoms the research examined more than covid patients and found that about of those who had a history of smoking saw their conditions progress to a more severe or critical state another study published last month by researchers at the university of california san francisco found that one in three young adults between the ages of and are at higher risk of having severe covid cases with smoking habits playing a big part patients are considered vulnerable if they have at least one risk factor set out by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc including health conditions and smoking habits more young people are giving up smoking younger smokers appear to be giving up smoking at a much higher rate than their older counterparts the study by ash found that of the million people who quit between april and june were aged between and for young people who have been quitting there s a desire to generally be more healthy and take control at a time in their lives where that control has been taken away hazel cheeseman the policy dierctor for ash told business insider younger people are more likely to be in employment that s been disrupted or have their education or social lives disrupted their lives have been much more affected by the experience of lockdown whereas older people have been in their own homes and maintained their own space cheeseman said that ash s findings have been surprising considering it is older people who are more at risk of contracting the coronavirus older smokers have been smoking longer because most people start in their teens they re therefore more likely to be more heavily addicted and therefore quitting is more difficult for them she said but they are also more insulated from some of the factors that have motivated people to quit right now while the survey results showed a sign of short term success for smokers giving up it remains to be seen if this translates into a continued pattern the world health organization who has also warned that the disease poses particular risks to smokers at a press briefing in july who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said smoking kills million people a year but if users need more motivation to kick the habit the pandemic provides the right incentive that incentive has worked for dutt he said that while it hasn t been easy he knows that it s for the better quitting has been incredibly difficult but nearing the reality of looking after one s health is more important than ever and i am no longer willing to allow a drug to rule my life dutt said,pos

this woman has rescued human trafficking victims hasina kharbhih s impulse ngo network has used an innovative model to rescue women and children trafficked across india myanmar bangladesh and nepal her innovative model partners with human rights organizations and governments across asia and europe and stands out for its emphasis on financial compensations and repatriation ella sangma was in her early teens and living in a shelter in new delhi when the authorities told her someone was coming to take her back to northeast india i was doubtful i had been taken for a ride earlier says sangma who was sold by her mother to human traffickers as a child and brought to the indian capital where she was forced to keep the books at a liquor store connected to a brothel but there was something about hasina kharbhih that earned the teen s instant trust sangma who now calls kharbhih amma mother agreed to return to northeast india with her sangma is just one among the more than women and children who have been victims of human trafficking across india myanmar bangladesh and nepal and now find themselves free thanks to kharbhih for kharbhih it s a matter of empathy as she strives to put a dent in the billion human trafficking industry in india and its surrounding countries when i arrive at a british era building in shillong in the northeast indian hill state of meghalaya kharbhih wearing a traditional wraparound skirt and her hair in a bun welcomes me into her office library children were being taken away by recruiters who promised them better paying jobs and put them into forced labor as domestic maids tea stall helpers miners or sex slaves hasina kharbhih kharbhih was just a schoolgirl in shillong when she started supporting the social development of vulnerable communities in the northeast the area is rife with human trafficking due to its porous borders with nepal myanmar and bangladesh rampant poverty and clashes between locals and the indian military during the war that resulted in the formation of bangladesh kharbhih s father housed refugees in their farmhouse i was born the year these people got to go back but the stories remain etched in my brain kharbhih says he did that as a human being and not a social worker and maybe that got into me i understood what you can do for human beings while in school she started cooking and cleaning at retirement homes and orphanages that early volunteer work became the impulse ngo network kharbhih decided to go to a college with stacked early morning classes which gave her more time for social work than a social life by impulse was registered as a rural livelihood initiative for female artisans in the east khasi hills district of meghalaya the initiative s focus shifted after a supreme court of india order banning the felling of trees in the northeast while conservationists celebrated the ruling came as a devastating blow for many female artisans including those adjacent to the village where kharbhih s grandmother lived who depended on access to bamboo and cane for their weaving the forest resources ban forced the rural communities to seek employment in urban areas and that eventually led many to become victims of human trafficking kharbhih says in her trademark soft calm voice we found that children were being taken away by recruiters who promised them better paying jobs and put them into forced labor as domestic maids tea stall helpers miners or sex slaves she reoriented the organization to tackle the spiraling problem in impulse took on its first human trafficking case after prerana a mumbai based nongovernmental organization rescued three northeastern girls from a red light district in the city impulse s immediate challenge was how to work with the government and for that it needed a plan of action that turned out to be what is now called the meghalaya model or the impulse model the trafficking tracking system focuses on the six r s reporting rescue rehabilitation repatriation reintegration and restitution and the six p s partnership prevention protection policing press and prosecution karbhih s tracking center works with nongovernmental organizations and governmental departments across south and southeast asia and has been endorsed by the united kingdom anyone can report a case to the impulse case info centre icic which quickly connects local authorities and ngos once a rescue operation is carried out icic collaborates with social welfare departments and ngos to provide shelter medical care and a long term plan whether that s vocational training or returning the person home and they follow up to make sure trafficking survivors receive financial compensation ajailiu niumai a professor of sociology at the university of hyderabad who researches human trafficking in northeast india believes that what makes kharbhih s model different from others across india are the components of repatriation and financial compensation besides niumai adds impulse has been able to take their model to the global platform by connecting with the organizations across south asia and also europe but niumai also points out that there are regional factors at play what is possible in the hills of the northeast is actually more difficult in the urban regions of for example south india she says here down south families are not willing to take back trafficked victims so there are a lot more cases of re trafficking the best thing about kharbhih sangma tells me is the way she listens to survivors and incorporates feedback to evolve the system when sangma became the only survivor to testify in court against a human trafficker kharbhih was always with her flying back and forth between meghalaya and new delhi sangma emerged from the courtroom to

dozens of elephants set free as chairs used to carry tourists are scrapped in wake of covid downturn dozens of elephants were set free this morning march as their owners scrapped the heavy wooden chairs that are tied to their backs for carrying tourists the jumbos at the maesa elephant camp in chiang mai northern thailand have been giving rides to holidaymakers for years but the covid coronavirus has decimated tourism with no end to the pandemic in sight and a ban on such businesses opening owners have decided to scrap the huge wooden and metal carriages that are strapped to the elephants backs throughout the day camp director anchalee kalampichit said this was the first time in years that the elephants had not worn the seats at the start of the day she said the company will now change their business to allow the elephants to roam freely in the grounds and operate as a place for visitors to observe the animals and all of the jumbos will never have to wear them again she said since we entered the business in riding on the elephants has always been the favourite activity of tourists but because the coronavirus has spread there have been fewer tourists and eventually the government ordered us to close so we have removed the chairs to liberate the elephants we are not planning to put the seat supports back on the elephants even if we can operate again we want to change the style of the place and find more natural ways that the public can enjoy the elephants we will welcome tourists to enjoy learning about the elephants ways of life naturally instead of using them to entertain the tourists anchalee added that the government enforced closure of the elephant camp along with other types of non essential customer facing businesses means that the owners will have to take care of the animals without any revenue from customers she said the cost for taking care of the elephants and staff is five million thb gbp per month so for now we have to bear that expense without income from tourists but we will not leave anyone behind and will try to take the best care of the elephants for as long as we can now we are planting vegetables for the staff to eat as one of the ways we can reduce the expenses in chiang mai where there are elephant camps of varying size officials said that of them were facing closure unless the situation improved boontha chailert president of the chiang mai tourism business association and the maetaeng elephant park said hundreds of other elephant centres around thailand were also facing closure due to the lack of tourists,pos

they just told us to go home and wait but lethbridge could not wait i just couldn t get it out of my head that he d crashed somewhere he said samuel had been driving back from the central coast around am on sunday he had messaged his girlfriend and arranged to meet her at the family home at blacksmiths after she finished work around lunchtime he never arrived as lethbridge s mind raced he recalled an accident from a few years earlier along the same stretch of the pacific highway that he believed samuel would have been driving on that driver wasn t found for five days and he d passed away lethbridge said that was in my head so i just thought bugger this i m not going to sit around and wait with the way the bush is there if a car goes in you re not going to see it the only way you ll

helicopter bad said mitchell a helicopter pilot with years flying experience he told us it was for missing son and said he believed his son had run off the road somewhere the company had cancelled training flights for that morning because of high winds whipping the hunter region but it immediately agreed to start the search as lethbridge who struggles with flying drove off to go and pick up his brother the flight crew readied the helicopter lethbridge s brother michael took the flight while lethbridge and his wife waited for news from the family home at blacksmiths it didn t take long within minutes they received news that a car fitting the description of samuel s vehicle had been spotted just off the pacific highway near crangan bay immediately tony began the frantic drive out to the site the car was buried in deep bushland and it was unclear from the helicopter if there was anyone inside the chopper put samuel s uncle on the ground near the former big prawn service station as his uncle made the grim approach to the crash site the pilot hovered above to provide a reference for lethbridge and emergency services fearing what he might find when he arrived samuel s uncle began to call his name as he began the metre walk down to the accident site there was no response but then michael lethbridge spotted samuel moving his head inside the wreck at that point he sent a text message to his brother he s alive when i got there i ran down there and it was just jubilation tony lethbridge said it was unbelievable to find him there trapped in his vehicle for what was nearing hours samuel was dehydrated and suffering serious injuries a broken thigh bone was protruding three inches through the skin you wouldn t have seen him if it wasn t for the helicopter because i couldn

mit will post free plans online for an emergency ventilator that can be built for clinical and design considerations will be published online goal is to support rapid scale up of device production to alleviate hospital shortages one of the most pressing shortages facing hospitals during the covid emergency is a lack of ventilators these machines can keep patients breathing when they no longer can on their own and they can cost around each now a rapidly assembled volunteer team of engineers physicians computer scientists and others centered at mit is working to implement a safe inexpensive alternative for emergency use which could be built quickly around the world the team called mit e vent for emergency ventilator was formed on march in response to the rapid spread of the covid pandemic its members were brought together by the exhortations of doctors friends and a sudden flood of mail referencing a project done a decade ago in the mit class medical device design students working in consultation with local physicians designed a simple ventilator device that could be built with about worth of parts they published a paper detailing their design and testing but the work ended at that point now with a significant global need looming a new team linked to that course has resumed the project at a highly accelerated pace the key to the simple inexpensive ventilator alternative is a hand operated plastic pouch called a bag valve resuscitator or ambu bag which hospitals already have on hand in large quantities these are designed to be operated by hand by a medical professional or emergency technician to provide breaths to a patient in situations like cardiac arrest until an intervention such as a ventilator becomes available a tube is inserted into the patient s airway as with a hospital ventilator but then the pumping of air into the lungs is done by squeezing and releasing the flexible pouch this is a task for skilled personnel trained in how to evaluate the patient and adjust the timing and pressure of the pumping accordingly the innovation begun by the earlier mit class and now being rapidly refined and tested by the new team was to devise a mechanical system to do the squeezing and releasing of the ambu bag since this is not something that a person could be expected to do for any extended period but it is crucial for such a system to not damage the bag and to be controllable so that the amount of air and pressures being delivered can be tailored to the particular patient the device must be very reliable since an unexpected failure of the device could be fatal but as designed by the mit team the bag can be immediately operated manually the team is particularly concerned about the potential for well meaning but inexperienced do it yourselfers to try to reproduce such a system without the necessary clinical knowledge or expertise with hardware that can operate for days around million cycles would be required to support a ventilated patient over a two week period furthermore it requires code that is fault tolerant since ventilators are precision devices that perform a life critical function to help curtail the spread of misinformation or poorly thought out advice the team has added to their website verified information resources on the clinical use of ventilators and the requirements for training and monitoring in using such systems all of this information is freely available at e vent mit edu we are releasing design guidance clinical mechanical electrical controls testing on a rolling basis as it is developed and documented one team member says we encourage capable clinical engineering teams to work with their local resources while following the main specs and safety information and we welcome any input other teams may have the researchers emphasize that this is not a project for typical do it yourselfers to undertake since it requires specialized understanding of the clinical technical interface and the ability to work in consideration of strict u s food and drug administration specifications and guidelines such devices have to be manufactured according to fda requirements and should only be utilized under the supervision of a clinician a team member said the department of health and human services released a notice stating that all medical interventions related to covid are no longer subject to liability but that does not change our burden of care he said at present we are awaiting fda feedback about the project ultimately our intent is to seek fda approval that process takes time however the all volunteer team is working without funding and operating anonymously for now because many of them have already been swamped by inquiries from people wanting more information and are concerned about being overwhelmed by calls that would interfere with their work on the project we would really really like to just stay focused says one team member and that s one of the reasons why the website is so essential so that we can communicate with anyone who wants to read about what we are doing and also so that others across the world can communicate with us the primary consideration is patient safety so we had to establish what we re calling minimum clinical functional requirements that is the minimum set of functions that the device would need to perform to be both safe and useful says one of the team members who is both an engineer and an md he says one of his jobs is to translate between the specialized languages used by the engineers and the medical professionals on the team that determination of minimum requirements was made by a team of physicians with broad clinical backgrounds including anesthesia and critical care he says in parallel the group set to work on designing building and testing an updated prototype initial tests revealed the high loads that actual use incurs and some weaknesses that have already been addressed so that in the words of team co leads even the professor can kick it across the room in other words early attempts focused on super makability were too optimistic new versions have already been fabricated and are being prepared for additional functional tests already the team says there is enough detailed information on their website to allow other teams to work in parallel with them and they have also included links to other teams that are working on similar design efforts in under a week the team has gone from empty benches to their first realistic tests of a prototype one team member says that in the less than a week full they have been working motivated by reports of doctors already having to ration ventilators and the intense focus the diverse group has brought to this project they have already generated multiple theses worth of research the cross disciplinary nature of the group has been crucial one team member says the most exciting times and when the team is really moving fast are when we have an a design engineer sitting next to a controls engineer sitting next to the fabrication expert with an anesthesiologist on webex all solid modeling coding and spreadsheeting in parallel we are discussing the details of everything from ways to track patients vital signs data to the best sources for small electric motors the intensity of the work with people putting in very long hours every day has been tiring but hasn t dulled their enthusiasm we all work together and ultimately the goal is to help people because people s lives understandably hang in the balance he said reference design and

crime victim compensation an overview return to documents quarterly newsletter crime victim compensation an overview crime victim compensation programs across the country offer crucial financial assistance to victims of violence this overview provides information on how the programs operate and what victims can do to seek help victims of violent crime may suffer financial stress as devastating as their physical injuries and emotional trauma recovering from violence or abuse is difficult enough without having to worry about how to pay for the costs of medical care and counseling or about how to replace lost income due to disability or death the good news is that every state has a crime victim compensation program that can provide substantial financial assistance to crime victims and their families and while no amount of money can erase the trauma and grief victims suffer this aid can be crucial in the aftermath of crime by paying for care that helps restore victims physical and mental health and by replacing lost income for victims who cannot work and for families who lose a breadwinner compensation programs are assisting victims in direct ways compensation programs are now serving an ever increasing number of victims with larger amounts of benefits than ever before despite a substantial decline in violent crime there are a third fewer crimes committed each year now compared to applications and payouts continue to grow in most states the national total of benefits is at record high levels and programs are addng new compensable costs and expanding outreach to ensure that more victims needs are met crime victim compensation was the first type of organized victim assistance in the united states the earliest compensation program was created in in california and nine states were operating such programs by when the earliest programs providing other types of direct victim assistance were established today compensation programs across the country are paying out close to million annually to more than victims fittingly most of this money comes from offenders rather than tax dollars since a large majority of states fund their programs entirely through fees and fines charged against those convicted of crime federal grants to compensation programs providing about of the money for payments to victims also come solely from offender fines and assessments victims of rape assault child sexual abuse drunk driving and domestic violence as well as the families of homicide victims are all eligible to apply for financial help statistics show that victims of assault comprise about half of the claimants for compensation with more than a third of those claims being paid to domestic violence victims child sexual abuse victims comprise of the victims helped by compensation programs about of benefits overall are paid to families of homicide victims and goes toward sexual assault victims compensation programs can pay for a wide variety of expenses and losses related to criminal injury and homicide beyond medical care mental health treatment funerals and lost wages a number of programs also cover crime scene cleanup travel costs to receive treatment moving expenses and the cost of housekeeping and child care if a victim is unable to perform those tasks and states continue to work with victims and advocates to find new ways to help victims with more of the costs of recovery while each state operates under its own law all compensation programs have the same basic criteria to determine eligibility for benefits it is very important however to check with the individual state to see exactly what its requirements are and the program directory on this website can be useful in doing that generally the victim must a report the crime promptly to law enforcement and cooperate with police and prosecutors many states allow exceptions to this requirement particularly for child victims b submit a timely victim compensation application again some exceptions may be possible c have a cost or loss not covered by insurance or another government benefit program victim compensation programs pay only after other collateral sources are used and d not have committed a criminal act or some substantially wrongful act that caused or contributed to the crime the eligibility of family members generally depends on the behavior of the victim when programs assess this requirement apprehension or conviction of the offender is not required maximum benefits available from the states average with some states able to offer more and some states having lower limits lower caps within the maximum are common for some types of benefits like funeral and burial costs mental health counseling or lost wages telling victims about compensation is the responsibility of every individual who works in victim services and law enforcement this resource also should be made known by those who provide medical and counseling services compensation programs depend largely on these professionals who work with victims daily to get the message out that financial assistance is available and programs typically expend a great deal of time and effort in providing training and information to them we encourage everyone with a role in helping victims to get more details from the program in their state by contacting it directly,pos

served as one of members of the national academy of medicine s committee on health and medical dimensions of social isolation and loneliness in older adults the committee recently released a report titled social isolation and loneliness in older adults opportunities for the health care system it looked at the health impact of social isolation and loneliness in adults over and made recommendations for health care organizations and in a press briefing march who epidemiologist maria van kerkhove said that physical distance doesn t mean that socially we have to disconnect from our loved ones from our family importance of social connections social connections between humans are important thompson said the thing about the connection they help us feel valued she said and it adds meaning to our lives katie dorough veit a professor at ut s college of social work and a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in anxiety depression and grief explained when we see someone it provides a sense of hope and safety because it lets us know we can be connected with others but access to in person contact has been limited the cdc has advised against gatherings of more than people bars restaurants gyms churches and other staples where people interact socially are closed this can lead to a feeling of loneliness there is a correlation between feeling lonely and depression and anxiety dorough veit said she added loneliness can add to increased feelings of depressive symptoms a feeling of hopelessness there is a difference between social isolation and the feeling of loneliness loneliness is the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely novak wrote in an email social isolation on the other hand is the objective lack of or limited social contact with others not all people who feel lonely are socially isolated and not all people who are isolated feel lonely there can be someone for example living with friends or family but still feeling alone and there can be another person who is living alone but doesn t feel lonely loneliness can also have negative physical effects on people particularly older adults there is strong evidence that in adults poor social relationships have been shown to increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease and stroke and also to an increased risk of dementia novak wrote and as people start feeling lonely it can lead to changes in behavior because some may turn to negative coping strategies to combat the feeling thompson said the changes can range from how many cigarettes one smokes in a day to how much alcohol one consumes to how one responds to stress and stressors and one stressor is the impact the pandemic is having on the jobs market the number of unemployment claims has surged for two weeks across the state losing a job already adds stress as people start to worry how to pay their bills and buy supplies but for many people their professions are wrapped into their identity thompson said that s almost a loss of self what to do if feeling lonely here are some things novak thompson and dorough veit recommendation for people who feel lonely,pos

eu agrees total ban on bee harming pesticides the european union will ban the world s most widely used insecticides from all fields due to the serious danger they pose to bees the ban on neonicotinoids approved by member nations on friday is expected to come into force by the end of and will mean they can only be used in closed greenhouses bees and other insects are vital for global food production as they pollinate three quarters of all crops the plummeting numbers of pollinators in recent years has been blamed in part on the widespread use of pesticides the eu banned the use of neonicotinoids on flowering crops that attract bees such as oil seed rape in but in february a major report from the european union s scientific risk assessors efsa concluded that the high risk to both honeybees and wild bees resulted from any outdoor use because the pesticides contaminate soil and water this leads to the pesticides appearing in wildflowers or succeeding crops a recent study of honey samples revealed global contamination by neonicotinoids vytenis andriukaitis european commissioner for health and food safety welcomed friday s vote the commission had proposed these measures months ago on the basis of the scientific advice from efsa bee health remains of paramount importance for me since it concerns biodiversity food production and the environment the ban on the three main neonicotinoids has widespread public support with almost million people signing a petition from campaign group avaaz banning these toxic pesticides is a beacon of hope for bees said antonia staats at avaaz finally our governments are listening to their citizens the scientific evidence and farmers who know that bees can t live with these chemicals and we can t live without bees martin dermine at pesticide action network europe said authorising neonicotinoids a quarter of a century ago was a mistake and led to an environmental disaster today s vote is historic however the pesticide manufacturers and some farming groups have accused the eu of being overly cautious and suggested crop yields could fall a claim rejected by others european agriculture will suffer as a result of this decision said graeme taylor at the european crop protection association perhaps not today perhaps not tomorrow but in time decision makers will see the clear impact of removing a vital tool for farmers the uk s national farmers union nfu said the ban was regrettable and not justified by the evidence guy smith nfu deputy president said the pest problems that neonicotinoids helped farmers tackle have not gone away there is a real risk that these restrictions will do nothing measurable to improve bee health while compromising the effectiveness of crop protection a spokesman for the uk department of environment food and rural affairs welcomed the ban but added we recognise the impact a ban will have on farmers and will continue to work with them to explore alternative approaches in november uk environment secretary michael gove overturned the uk s previous opposition to a full outdoor ban neonicotinoids which are nerve agents have been shown to cause a wide range of harm to individual bees such as damaging memory and reducing queen numbers but this evidence has strengthened recently to show damage to colonies of bees other research has also revealed that of all flying insects have disappeared in germany and probably much further afield prompting warnings of ecological armageddon prof dave goulson at the university of sussex said the eu ban was logical given the weight of evidence but that disease and lack of flowery habitats were also harming bees also if these neonicotinoids are simply replaced by other similar compounds then we will simply be going round in circles what is needed is a move towards truly sustainable farming he said some experts are worried that the exemption for greenhouses means neonicotinoids will be washed out into water courses where they can severely harm aquatic life prof jeroen van der sluijs at the university of bergen norway said neonicotinoids will also continue to be used in flea treatments for pets and in stables and animal transport vehicles which account for about a third of all uses environmental pollution will continue the eu decision could have global ramifications according to prof nigel raine at the university of guelph in canada policy makers in other jurisdictions will be paying close attention to these decisions we rely on both farmers and pollinators for the food we eat pesticide regulation is a balancing act between unintended consequences of their use for non target organisms including pollinators and giving farmers the tools they need to control crop pests,pos

gray wolves to be reintroduced to colorado in unprecedented vote in colorado the wolves are coming home voters in the state narrowly approved a ballot initiative proposition paving the way for gray wolves to be reintroduced into colorado where they were hunted to extinction by the s this is the first time a state has voted to reintroduce an animal to the ecosystem the colorado parks and wildlife department will lead the effort to establish a sustainable population of the animals in the western part of the state beginning in or the southern rocky mountains contain millions of acres of suitable habitat where wolves once thrived land that could support several hundred wolves or more biologists say opponents of the initiative conceded they had lost on november but the vote was close as of thursday afternoon with percent of the votes in there were votes for and against but most of the remaining uncounted votes come from urban areas that strongly support reintroduction reintroducing wolves will restore colorado s natural balance says jonathan proctor a conservationist with the group defenders of wildlife which assisted the rocky mountain wolf action fund in passing the measure supporters say it s especially timely since the federal government removed endangered species act protections for the animals in the contiguous u s in late october learn more gray wolves taken off u s endangered species list in controversial move the colorado reintroduction initiative was opposed by many in rural areas including ranchers who worry that wolves will kill their cattle many of these opponents have objected to leaving the question of reintroduction to voters rather than state wildlife officials shawn martini spokesperson for coloradans for protecting wildlife which opposes the initiative says state biologists have previously declined to introduce wolves this is the first time that any species would be introduced via the ballot box and there s a reason it s never been done before direct democracy certainly has its limits he says please be respectful of copyright unauthorized use is prohibited advocates point to the successful reintroduction of wolves to the northern rockies in the s where only one in cattle in wolf occupied counties are killed by the predators on average proctor says the colorado initiative will also fund a program to reimburse ranchers for lost livestock some hunters also opposed the measure for fear of losing elk to the predators though in the northern rockies records show wolves have not impacted elk harvests lone wolves wolves once ranged over most of north america but were nearly wiped out by the early th century in the contiguous u s by widespread hunting trapping and poisoning much of it government sponsored with only a small population hanging on in the great lakes region they were placed on the endangered species list in the s and in and the federal government reintroduced wolves to yellowstone national park and idaho from there the animals spread to montana washington state oregon and northern california but wolves still haven t established a permanent population in colorado there s also a formidable distance of several hundred miles between the greater yellowstone ecosystem and the colorado state line and wolves that attempt to travel south can be killed in wyoming where it s legal to kill them throughout

berger who wasn t directly involved in the reintroduction initiative is excited about the prospect of a connected population of wolves from canada down to mexico that will help the species maintain genetic diversity as they reclaim their former habitat long term wolves have a good chance of moving beyond colorado for example into new mexico that could lead to the introduction of new genes into the endangered and inbred population of mexican gray wolves in arizona and new mexico explains michael robinson a conservation advocate with the center for biological diversity an organization also involved in passing the ballot initiative robinson has been pushing for wolf reintroduction in colorado for decades wolf benefits the livestock industry some hunting groups and the colorado farm bureau rallied against the measure which was supported largely by voters in urban areas martini stresses that the majority of rural residents in western colorado have opposed the measure whereas supportive urban voters won t have to live alongside the animals a scenario he considers unfair but conservationists point to the beneficial role of wolves as apex predators and keystone species they help thin out sick animals maintaining healthy populations of deer and elk thus limiting overgrazing and erosion proctor says by killing and competing with coyotes wolves can support higher populations of other small carnivores including foxes and the remains of wolf kills also provide food for many scavengers including endangered wolverines eagles and bears robinson says proctor also emphasizes that the experience of living with wolves in other places like the northern rockies has shown that wolves are not the threat people sometimes make them out to be reintroduction program biologists will make it a priority to work with people who live alongside wolves for example providing training and resources for ranchers to help prevent wolves from preying on cattle in the first place proctor adds colorado has the chance to be better than the other states he says by being inclusive,pos
scottish clan chief plans to rewild his isle of skye estate with native trees a scottish clan chief plans to rewild his ancestral estate as part of an ambitious project to transform the beautiful but not natural isle of skye hugh macleod the th chief of clan macleod hopes to overhaul the lunarscape surrounding dunvegan castle by planting a total of native trees in its land it is hoped these broadleaf forests will provide a home for reintroduced beaver populations and the declining numbers of red squirrels and wildcats which inhabit parts of scotland the ambitious project which has been in development on the acre macleod estate for years has been awarded a million grant from the scottish government and the eu the native forest will contain different species mixtures to suit the land s terrain and ecology the carbon offset is estimated to exceed tons over a year period the focus will be on planting trees which historically grew in the isle of skye s peat soil such as birch rowan and cherry trees the daily telegraph reported hugh macleod chief of clan macleod of dunvegan hopes to overhaul the lunarscape surrounding dunvegan castle pictured by planting a total of native trees in its land it is hoped the rewilding strategy will encourage others to take on similar initiatives to restore skye s wet desert landscape which is a legacy of centuries of depredation caused by over grazing mr macleod the estate director said in a difficult year of persistent bad news i am thrilled that the macleod estate has been awarded this grant for one of the largest and most ambitious native woodland creation projects on the isle of skye i had the idea over ten years ago when i decided to stop farming at the estate s totachocaire farm which is not only marginal land but was also loss making for almost every year of its operation since it was revived by my late father in the s this is the first phase of our nascent rewilding plans and once the woodlands are established this will create an extensive and biodiverse habitat to support a number of native species it is hoped new broadleaf forests will provide a home for reintroduced beaver populations and the declining numbers of red squirrels and wildcats which inhabit parts of scotland pictured dunvegan castle on the isle of skye pictured the acre macleod estate where the rewilding project is set to take place how the isle of skye s beautiful but not natural landscape was manmade the isle of skye known for its rugged landscapes has been described by hugh macleod as a wet desert he says the scottish land is lacking wildlife and beautiful but not natural with native greenery no longer populating the dramatic landscape according to the clan chief the current landscape of the isle of skye makes clear it was an ancient woodland before the land was stripped bare by human activity the extensive peat bog on the island is particularly indicative of this he said this bog is an ombrotrophic mire which supports plant growth it is believed birch rowan cherry willow hawthorn and sycamore trees would have previously grown in the fertile peat soil however it has been suggested human activity and over grazing by farm animals caused the land to evolve into something beautiful but not natural advertisement he added the current landscape of the isle of skye is clear evidence it was an ancient woodland before the land was stripped bare by human activity after all the extensive peatbog on the island is clear evidence of ancient and widespread woodlands mr macleod said in common with other areas of the highlands skye s current lunarscape appearance is beautiful but it is not natural this project aims to restore this piece of land and it will have a positive ripple effect on the local community beyond the obvious ecological benefits creating more jobs in sustainable eco tourism and more rewilding initiatives mr macleod has been working to turn dunvegan castle into a successful tourist destination after inheriting the area from his late father john more than years ago the th century castle has been the ancestral home of clan macleod for more than years and now has an annual turnover of million with uk and international visitors each year the land includes the macleod tables cafe four retail outlets five holiday cottages seal trips amenity woodlands dunvegan pier and glenbrittle campsite the clan chief hopes the rewilding which is being overseen by scottish woodlands ltd will improve eco tourism and create more jobs on the isle of skye the project s first phase will focus on transforming dunvegan s former home farm totachocaire into a acre native woodland this new landscape will be three times the size of the existing contiguous woodlands around dunvegan castle and gardens a total of trees will be planted in addition to the native trees planted by the estate in to replace a monoculture coniferous plantation dating back to the post war years as one of the largest native woodland projects on the isle of skye this will bring the total number of native trees planted on the macleod estate since to mr macleod said the current landscape of the isle of skye pictured a peatbog is clear evidence it was an ancient woodland before the land was stripped bare by human activity it is also hoped the broadleaf forests will become a habitat for beavers which were released in scotland

a red state is capping interest rates on payday loans this transcends political ideology nebraska voters overwhelming chose to put limits on the interest rates that payday lenders can charge making it the th state to limit interest rates on the risky loans but consumer advocates cautioned that future protections related to payday loans may need to happen at the federal level because of recent changes in regulations with of precincts reporting of voters in nebraska approved initiative which will cap the annual interest charged for delayed deposit services or payday lending at on average payday lenders charge interest on the small dollar loans nationally according to the center for responsible lending a consumer advocacy group that supports expanded regulation of the industry by approving the ballot measure nebraska became the th state in the country plus the district of columbia to implement a cap on payday loans the overwhelming vote in a state where four of its five

lending they object to it read more for desperate americans considering a payday loan here are other options industry officials argued that the ballot measure would impede consumers access to credit and said that the rate cap makes it such that lenders will not be able to operate in the state it amounts to eliminating regulated small dollar credit in the state while doing nothing to meet nebraskans very real financial needs including amid the covid pandemic and economic downturn said ed d alessio executive director of infin a national trade association for the consumer financial services industry the ballot measure s success in nebraska could presage similar efforts in other states other states that have capped the interest payday lenders charge in recent years via ballot measures like nebraska s include colorado and south dakota this transcends political ideology said ashley harrington federal advocacy director at the center for responsible lending there is just something wrong with triple digit interest rates and trapping people in cycles of debt the experiences in those states add further support behind initiatives to cap interest on small dollar loans in south dakota the volume of unsecured and payday alternative loans offered by credit unions which are subject to an and rate cap has grown considerably since the ballot measure passed in research has shown and polls indicate continued support of the interest rate cap on payday loans among a vast majority of south dakotans federal regulators have loosened limits on the payday lending industry despite the measure s success in nebraska changes occurring at the federal level could weaken efforts to regulate the payday lending industry and cap the interest rates it charges in july the consumer financial protection bureau issued a new rule rescinding provisions of a rule that mandated that payday lenders must determine whether a person will be able to repay their loans critics of the payday industry have long argued that the high interest rates the loans carry cause people to fall into debt spirals whereby they must borrow new loans to pay off existing payday loans nalcab which is being represented by the center for responsible lending and public citizen filed a lawsuit in federal court last week against the cfpb looking to overturn the new rule meanwhile the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates national banks last month finalized the true lender rule this new regulation allows non bank lenders such as payday lenders to partner with banks to offer small dollar loans because the loans would be made through the bank they would not be subject to state based interest rate caps critics have called the new regulation a rent a bank scheme and argue it could harm consumers it s not a loophole it s a gaping tunnel poyo said in criticizing the occ s new regulation if democrat joe biden wins the presidential election his administration would take over leadership of both the cfpb and the occ and could rescind these new policies poyo said however harrington argued that the federal government should go a step further and create a federal cap on interest rates even if control of congress remains divided between democrats and republicans harrington said lawmakers should look to the success of the ballot measures in nebraska and south dakota as

companies had moved or are planning to move staff assets or other business out of london because of brexit while this is higher than previous estimates it underestimates the real picture the report published on friday said bank assets worth more than billion pounds or trillion about percent of the total assets in britain s banking system have been moved or are being moved the report said its authors eivind friis hamre and william wright wrote that these numbers might be smaller than the reality because their analysis might have missed banks and assets managers already based in the

warehouse the amazon warehouse in bessemer ala where amazon employees recently voted on unionization credit bob miller for the new york times the union that was soundly defeated in its efforts to organize an amazon warehouse in alabama is seeking to overturn the results of the election accusing the company of corrupting the voting process by intimidating and surveilling workers on monday the retail wholesale and department store union filed objections to the election with the national labor relations board which oversaw the voting by mail process last month the union lost its bid to organize the warehouse by a more than to ratio many workers said that the union had failed to persuade them of the benefits of organizing and that they were largely satisfied with the pay benefits and working conditions at amazon in a statement on monday amazon said rather than accepting these employees choice the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda we look forward to the next steps in the legal process at the heart of the union s complaint is a mailbox that amazon installed in the warehouse parking lot where workers could drop off their ballots the union said amazon had brought in the collection box without approval from the labor board the company also used video cameras that could monitor the workers who dropped off their ballots there and encouraged them to drop the ballots in the box rather than mail them from home the union said the union said these actions by amazon had created the impression that the collection box was a polling location and that the employer had control over the conduct of the mail ballot election the union also accused amazon of other tactics that may have intimidated workers such as hiring local police to patrol the parking lot area while organizers were outside and pulling possibly pro union workers out of captive audience meetings that the company held to address the organizing drive among the staff the company would request the employee to come forward have them identified and then removed from the meeting in the presence of hundreds of other employees thereby interfering with and or chilling the right of employees to freely discuss issues related to the union organizing campaign the union said in its filing with the labor board the union has asked the labor board to hold a hearing on its petition to set aside the results if the union is successful with its legal challenges the labor board could order that another election be held a coal miners union indicates it

for spending on research on carbon capture and storage technology which would allow coal fired plants to store carbon dioxide underground rather than release it into the atmosphere and for policies that allow coal plants to remain open if they commit to installing the technology the union wants the federal government to support miners who lose their jobs through retraining and by replacing their wages health insurance and pensions many of these proposals appear in president biden s trillion jobs and infrastructure plan including funding for research into carbon capture which critics deride as prohibitively expensive and money for reclaiming mines change is coming whether we seek it or not stated a document that the mine workers union released on monday titled preserving coal country it

elephant poaching africa has china s ivory ban stemmed crisis with massive tusks that touched the ground satao towered over the rest of his herd one of the last great tuskers the beast estimated to be around years old was heralded as kenya s biggest oldest and arguably most iconic elephant tourists from around the world would flock to see satao in his prime yet his celebrity status and the added protection it afforded him was not enough to save kenya s most beloved bull elephant on may th he was found dead he was the victim of a poacher s poisoned arrow his face crudely hacked off his ivory gone satao is just one casualty of the vicious ivory trade decimating the african elephant population a trade that is estimated to cost africa to elephants every year the continent s current population is estimated to be as low as a decline of more than since however it is not all bad news on december china s legal ivory trade ground to a standstill china is thought to be the world s largest consumer of ivory the move is in accordance with a announcement by chinese president xi jinping and former us president barack obama both leaders vowed to enact near complete ivory bans within their respective countries america s came into effect in june in november last year donald trump s administration announced it would lift the ban on importing elephant hunt trophies from zimbabwe and zambia but after a political backlash mr trump put the decision on hold the benefits of the decision are already starting to be felt craig millar head of security and field operations for big life foundation told news com au since china s ban on ivory has come into effect we ve seen not so much a drop in poaching but a drop in prices kenya has been showing a steady decline in poaching for the last three years and i m hoping this year it will be a decline again we reacted quite quickly to the most recent ivory poaching crisis so our elephant population is probably one of the least affected over the last five years mr millar added that a drop in prices is only a good thing immediately after the announcement we saw prices drop by as much as to per cent and that just means the poacher on the ground here is getting way less than anyone at the end of the supply chain so there s even less incentive for him to risk his life china seems to have a pretty firm hold of what s going on and the government deciding against something seems to be pretty readily accepted all that aside the poaching crisis has left is scars in kenya and the people working on the front line of conservation are not exempt there are two scenes that have stuck with me mr millar said there was one where six elephants were killed in a single poaching incident a whole family basically mowed down and one of those happened to be a pregnant female and just the other day i was flying and i saw a baby elephant less than a month old get killed not for its ivory that was more a case of senseless human wildlife conflict those are the worst things i ve ever seen on the job in addition to being faced with such brutal scenes mr millar and his team place their lives on the line on a daily basis to protect big life s animals the foundation currently manages an area just under two million acres there are lots of times you feel personally threatened doing this job but we ve been very lucky as we ve never lost a ranger to a poacher we ve just had injuries he said the biggest impact has been on the animals themselves the poaching crisis has brought around significant behavioural shifts mr millar has seen big life s resident big tusker one ton hide his tusks from human gaze by shoving his head into a bush on more than one occasion they re very clever i ve seen a number of other changes in the animals that can be attributed to poaching their behaviour changes drastically depending on which area they re in they know where they re safe and they ll be very relaxed one ton in particular you can almost touch if he s in the right place but you find him elsewhere and he s much more nervous it goes to the extent when if an elephant has been killed all other elephants will move away from the area for the next couple of days even if they weren t in the immediate vicinity they pass that message along it doesn t stop there if a bigger older animal does get killed it impacts the population for generations taking out an older female in a herd is taking out their knowledge store elephants teach their young for years and a female will be close to before she s ready to take on that role as a matriarch if you lose your top two or three females in a herd suddenly the survivors aren t going to know where to find water in the dry season where the best forage is how to protect each other males are hugely affected in that they bred right up until their old age they only slowdown in the last four to five years of their life taking out those big males means suddenly you re getting immature males breeding and passing on an inferior gene pool because they haven t really proven themselves while china s ban on ivory has had a positive impact the plight of the african elephant is far from over human wildlife conflict is still a very real threat the recent incident involving the baby elephant is an example a lot of our rangers time is now spent dealing with keeping elephants out of farms or people out of areas where the animals are likely to be dangerous mr millar explained we re looking at land use plans and implementing large scale electrified fencing of areas the fences have to be electric it s the only thing that stops elephants and the fences have to be a specific design as well it s hugely expensive it s about a per km we ve done about kms now and we re looking at doing at least

study finds bees don t just love cannabis it can also help save their dying populations humans aren t the only ones who seem to gravitate towards the marijuana plant turns out even bees love the buzz but for a slightly different reason a new study by researchers at cornell university published in the journal of environmental entomology finds that bees are super attracted to the cannabis plants because they can t get enough of its sweet sweet pollen this study supports the results of a similar one conducted by colorado university last year and opens up options for scientists to save the depleting bee population around the world the study found that the taller the cannabis plants are and the larger area they cover the more bees will flock to that farm with taller plants attracting times more buzz than the shorter ones what s even cooler is that there are different varieties of the marijuana plant that could support these bee populations but even as bees seem to love the cannabis plant they can t actually get high off it since insects aren t known to have any cannabinoid receptors these findings are kinda confusing when you consider that cannabis neither has a nectary taste nor the vibrant colours that generally catch the attention of bees however the bees are more into the male plants that usually grow alongside the flowering female ones that produce the bud you put into your bongs but have no psychoactive properties this study is especially crucial given that bees are responsible for the cross pollination of flowers that furthers the growth of the fruits and vegetables we need for survival except thanks to pesticides habit destruction and climate change the bees seem to be buzzing off something that the marijuana plant could help put a stop to since they also don t generally use too many pesticides nor require too much water for their growth but what s even better about these canna bees is that they bring with them immense industrial potential israeli cannabis technology company phytopharma international developed a natural cannabinoid dosed honey that allows bees to fuse thc and cbd into their honey by an ip protected pollination process now if that s not worth the buzz we don t know what is,pos

blood test detects proteins linked to alzheimer s disease cnn a team of scientists from australia and japan has developed a blood test to detect early signs of alzheimer s disease the noninvasive test was developed to detect the presence of the toxic protein amyloid beta known to be present in people affected by the disease and did so with accuracy according to the study published wednesday in the journal nature the team trialed the test on patients from japan and from australia with varying levels of health ranging from healthy to mild cognitive impairments or alzheimer s disease the idea behind the test is to predict the presence and levels of amyloid beta in a person s brain buildup of the abnormal protein in the brain is one sign of alzheimer s disease the most common form of dementia other teams have developed similar tests to detect alzheimer s with one study proving to have sensitivity and specificity this test is at least as good as current brain scan techniques and far surpasses existing blood tests said colin masters professor of dementia research at melbourne s florey institute of neuroscience and mental health who led the study but the researchers cautioned that they were still far from practical clinical application the onset of alzheimer s can come as early as years before the patient experiences any symptoms such as memory loss there is no concrete test to determine early onset of dementia and patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed based on a careful evaluation using brain scans and concise mental testing according to the alzheimer s society uk the study used blood samples from patients to detect levels of the toxic protein in the blood and in turn predict how much of it is in the brain there is no treatment available for alzheimer s disease but early detection can speed access to therapy progress in developing new therapeutic strategies for alzheimer s disease has been disappointingly slow none of the three drugs currently on the market treat the underlying disease masters said in a statement the team highlights that more research needs to be conducted across a wider population to make the results more conclusive and applicable clinically this is not a blood test for dementia that people who are worried about their memory and concentration should be asking their doctors about said rob howard professor of old age psychiatry at university college london who was not involved in the study not everyone with amyloid in their brains will turn out to have dementia and not everyone who has dementia will be found to have amyloid in their brains in the uk there are more than people affected by the disease costing billion according to the alzheimer s society follow cnn health on facebook and twitter see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter though the new study provides a breakthrough in research it is performed only in laboratories in japan where it will take up to a year to conform it to a level suitable to distribute to other laboratories and apply it to clinical trials we need to see whether the test works in a larger population but it has the potential both to speed up clinical trials and help people in the very early stages of alzheimer s to access new treatments if and when they become available said doug brown policy and research officer at the alzheimer s society uk carol routledge director of research at alzheimer s research uk said that further work with more people will need to build on this study to understand how well this approach could predict those who will go on to develop symptoms of alzheimer s in the future,pos
rare black panther confirmed in kenya the headline was updated on february to clarify that this is the first scientifically documented sighting since they say that black cats bring bad luck but when nick pilfold heard about one lurking around central kenya he knew he was onto something special the kenya based biologist and his team deployed a set of camera traps throughout the bushlands of loisaba conservancy in early it wasn t long before he got what he was looking for undeniable proof of a super rare melanistic leopard the juvenile female was spotted traveling with a larger normally colored leopard presumed to be her mother see our exclusive picture of a rare black wildcat seen in africa the opposite of albinism melanism is the result of a gene that causes a surplus of pigment in the skin or hair of an animal so that it appears black melanistic leopards have been reported in and around kenya for decades but scientific confirmation of their existence remains quite rare published in january in the african journal of ecology these photos represent the first scientific documentation of such a creature in africa in nearly a century as recently as only a single sighting had been confirmed a photograph taken in addis ababa ethiopia and stored in the collections of the national museum of natural history in washington d c their range across much of the continent has shrunk by at least percent due to habitat loss and prey decline almost everyone has a story about seeing one it s such a mythical thing says pilfold of san diego zoo global s institute for conservation research even when you talk to the older guys that were guides in kenya many years ago back when hunting was legal in the s and s there was a known thing that you didn t hunt black leopards if you saw them you didn t take it life in the shade there are nine leopard subspecies ranging from africa all the way to eastern russia and while percent of leopards alive today are thought to be melanistic says pilfold most are found in southeast asia where tropical forests offer an abundance of shade it s thought that melanism provides additional camouflage in those habitats giving the predators an advantage when it comes to hunting says vincent naude leopard genetic forensics project coordinator for the nonprofit panthera who was not involved with this research but in kenya black leopards sometimes referred to as black panthers an umbrella term that refers to any big cat with a black coat seem to occur in semi arid shrubland our leopards live in savannah type environments so having that extra melanism doesn t give them an adaptive advantage says naude even still given their nocturnal lifestyle a bit of additional pigmentation certainly doesn t hurt also see strawberry leopard discovered a first the fact the young female was traveling with her mother also suggests that her unique coloration hasn t had an impact on familial bonding pilfold notes comical coincidence after hearing about pilfold s findings staff at ol ari nyiro conservancy miles west of loisaba turned up a high quality image of a second black leopard taken in may since that photo is more than a decade older the researchers conclude it must be of a different individual which suggests black panthers are more prevalent in kenya than in other african countries but african black panthers are still so rare that researchers don t even know if the genetic mutation responsible for the dark pigmentation is the same one that underlies melanism in southeast asian leopards pilfold adds it s curious that the fictional country of wakanda home of the superhero black panther is located in east africa fairly close to kenya it s a unique coincidence says pilfold the only place where we have black leopards is where this place in the marvel universe appears to exist,pos

anchorage funds a new mental health first responder team starting next year anchorage will change its approach to dealing with people experiencing a mental health crisis with new money from an alcohol tax the city will fund a team of mental health first responders that can take the place of a police officer when responding to someone with a mental health issue the idea is that first responders trained in mental health can be dispatched to situations that police are not trained to respond to anchorage assemblywoman meg zaletel one of the sponsors said that will better suit the needs of the person in crisis while easing the burden on the anchorage police department zaletel an attorney who has practiced mental health law for years called it a fundamental shift to the local response system she championed the idea along with assemblymen chris constant and forrest dunbar and acting mayor austin quinn davidson there are details in the press release but the basic premise is this our police receive thousands of calls every year for people in mental health crisis our officers are not social workers or behavioral health specialists though they are often pressed into service as such forrest dunbar forrestdunbarak november right now when police respond to someone in a mental health crisis zaletel said the person often ends up in jail or a psychiatric unit at the hospital those can be traumatic experiences and not necessarily the correct response the mobile crisis team will aim to provide a tailored response as well as limit situations that could result in a violent interaction between police and a member of the public it s the right tool for the job and i think we need to recognize that the anchorage police department was already looking at models like this she said following the passage of the municipality s budget last week which included funding for the mobile crisis team the anchorage police department issued a statement supporting the program this is an important step forward for our community in meeting the needs of those in crisis deputy chief kenneth mccoy said in the statement we intently studied communities in the lower who were using the mobile crisis team model and are pleased to see this first step in addressing the need celeste hodge growden president of the alaska black caucus said the team will be a valuable resource especially during the covid pandemic when everyone is facing increased stress and anxiety hodge growden in an interview listed off fatal interactions between people of color and the police throughout the country she said in many stressful situations law enforcement is not what s needed we just have unfortunately too many situations that show overrepresentation of people of color experiencing the brunt of situations like this and i think compassionate care is what s needed and to resolve the situation in a way that doesn t get someone killed she said the program initially is expected to cost million for the first half of the year it will operate hours per day seven days a week a team will consist of a paramedic and a behavioral health clinician as well as a unit commander the alcohol tax is projected to bring in more than million per year though zaletel said there hasn t yet been a new projection that considers the impacts of the covid pandemic she said after the first quarter of there will be a more accurate idea of how much money the tax will bring in the tax will also go to fund domestic violence prevention programs prekindergarten child abuse prevention programs substance misuse treatment and housing and shelter for the homeless zaletel said the hope is that by july there will be a better idea of available funding and data from the first six months of the mobile crisis team to make a case for increasing the program to hour coverage that zaletel said would divert an estimated calls annually from the police that s quite a cost savings to apd she said hodge growden said she will continue to push for city leaders to better fund things like crisis intervention this is the beginning she said this is just our first step it s also intended to be a proactive step that would limit the burden on other intervention systems within hours of the crisis team s initial response they will follow up with the person and refer them to other services like a counselor zaletel said it could be the case where the cause of a crisis is rooted in food insecurity the team could follow up and inform the person of the various food pantries the idea is to deal with the root of the problem rather than allowing it to spiral,pos

hospitals sued to keep prices secret they lost a federal judge has upheld a trump administration policy that requires hospitals and health insurers to publish their negotiated prices for health services numbers that are typically kept secret the policy is part of a major push by the administration to improve transparency in health care insurers and health providers usually negotiate deals behind closed doors and patients rarely know the cost of services until after the fact administration officials said more price transparency would lead to lower and more predictable prices in an industry that has huge ranges in what insurers pay for services a simple blood test for example can cost or coronavirus tests show a similar variation with prices from to but in a lawsuit the american hospital association said the administration did not have the legal authority to require the publication of negotiated prices arguing that the publication of the prices could have perverse effects on tuesday the judge carl nichols disagreed,pos

new treatment may help slow progression of als research shows an experimental medication may slow the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als researchers reported wednesday the research was supported in part by donations from the ice bucket challenge the social media sensation that raised more than million worldwide the drug is not a cure but it may help slow the inexorable disability caused by als which rapidly destroys the nerve cells that control the muscles that allow us to move speak eat and even breathe patients keep telling me their no goal is to be able to retain physical function for as long as possible said the study s lead author dr sabrina paganoni a neuromuscular specialist at massachusetts general hospital s sean m healey amg center for als they want to be able to continue to walk and to use their hands about people in the u s have als at any given time according to the als association it usually strikes between the ages of and once symptoms set in life expectancy is two to six years on average the treatment studied by paganoni and her colleagues targets two cellular structures damaged by the disease the mitochondria which are the cells power plants and the endoplasmic reticulum the cellular dump trucks that cart away waste that can gunk up the cells machinery the multicenter randomized double blind study is the second step a phase trial in a three step process required by the food and drug administration for drug approval in a double blind study neither the patients nor the researchers know who is receiving the drug if a phase study generates positive results the fda typically requires a larger and longer phase trial to test the effectiveness of the two drug combination the researchers recruited als patients who had become symptomatic within the previous months about two thirds of the patients received the drug while the remaining third were given a placebo participants were evaluated on a scale of to measuring the disabilities caused by the disease by the time they entered the trial on average patients had already lost points their baseline score was about on average paganoni said each question addresses a specific domain of function and is scored on a scale from zero to four for example for walking normal early ambulation difficulties walks with assistance nonambulatory functional movement only no purposeful leg movement during the six months of the study patients taking the medication lost an average of points less than those receiving placebos a percent better functional outcome a to point change can mean the difference between being able to do an activity independently or with an assistance device paganoni said the trial did not show a difference between medication and placebo in outcomes such as time to death tracheostomy or permanent intubation or hospitalization but that may be because it ran for just six months paganoni suspects that if it is approved the new drug would be just one part of a cocktail of medications that would help to keep als at bay because the trial showed that the medication might make a difference all participants were offered the opportunity to stay on it or in the cases of those who were given placebos to start on it the mass general researchers will track how the patients taking the medication do in the long term paganoni credited the ice bucket challenge for getting her study and others going the ice bucket challenge was an important turning point in the fight against als she said it put als on the map and raised awareness of the disease and attracted more investigators and investment to the research with the good news from the trial the als association hopes to persuade the fda to allow other patients to have access to the drug even before phase trial results are available it s very unusual for an als clinical trial to hit its primary endpoint so we re very excited about it said neil thakur chief mission officer for the als association it s the difference between being able to feed oneself versus being fed or needing versus not needing a wheelchair als experts cautioned against rushing ahead without more data the current data are definitely positive but they need to be replicated said dr martina wiedau pazos a neurologist who is director of the als clinic and research center at ucla this study has limitations such as being small and lasting just six months i think a phase trial is needed because in the past positive outcomes from phase trials were not confirmed in phase trials another issue is that the study included subjects who had more rapid disease progression than normal said dr david lacomis chief of the neuromuscular division at upmc in pittsburgh so it s unclear what the effects would be in the broader als population lacomis said via email while the new findings are promising they are not earth shattering said dr erik pioro director of the section of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and related disorders at the cleveland clinic but it does add credence to the idea that other pathways are playing significant roles in als pathogenesis results of the trial were published in the new

here s who to thank that we all survived the quake on friday for the second time in years an earthquake damaged roads and buildings across anchorage and shook people in a way few will ever forget the good friday earthquake and the quake friday had many differences starting with the wonderful fact that no one died this time died in the quake the geological differences are interesting and important too but one thing is the same like every big earthquake they taught us who is really in charge to the extent we listen to that lesson we can protect ourselves and those who come after us that s important because we can be sure this wasn t anchorage s last big earthquake indeed magnitude quakes are expected regularly on the alaska aleutian subduction zone the nearby location made the shaking so severe in anchorage our number came up and it will again i don t want to minimize what happened it was big of full screen full screen autoplay autoplay close skip ad caption buy this photo vine road south of wasilla was heavily damaged by an earthquake on november marc lester adn wait second to continue the damage will be expensive that begins with precious things that were broken survivors often say as they should that those are only material things not comparable to the value of our safety in coming through without deaths or many serious injuries but irreplaceable things that are lost do count it s natural to grieve over a grandmother s china or a now grown child s smashed artwork the financial expense will be significant too and we re only starting to understand that roads bridges and schools will be repaired with government funds including emergency reserves and federal assistance the rush of relief funds after the quake which brought so much more damage saved alaska from an economic slump we can use the construction jobs these days too for homeowners the hit may be worse even if the numbers are smaller damaged foundations and chimneys can be extremely expensive to repair many alaskans don t have earthquake insurance and for those who do deductibles are high even though you dread looking it s worth locating that damage now having a home inspector find it a few years from now when you are trying to sell your house could compound the financial hit all that said the impact of this earthquake is nothing like that of the quake years ago which released almost times more energy it was a magnitude quake compared to magnitude this time the scale is logarithmic the quake relocated a block of the earth s crust carrying prince william sound and the kenai peninsula an area miles by miles the west side near seldovia sank into the ocean while the east side at montague island rose as much as feet the rupture lasted more than minutes and the shaking people felt went on longer after what happened friday you can understand how in some started believing the shaking would never stop they thought the world was ending the quake liquefied soil under west anchorage called bootlegger cove clay it s too soon to make firm statements about friday s quake but records from say the clay didn t collapse until well into the shaking this quake may not have lasted long enough for that to happen when the clay liquefied in buildings large and small went down in the turnagain area houses slid into the sea downtown fourth avenue split down the middle with businesses on the north side going down the hill in government hill a school broke in half and fell into a hole the motion in was very very different said mike west alaska s state seismologist not only did it last a long time but it was also more like rolling waves on the ocean rather than a vigorous shake the quake was extremely rare one of only a few in the world ever recorded that strong and not expected to return for perhaps years afterward a debate raged for a decade about how to prepare for another earthquake a group of scientists and planners wanted to make the turnagain area into a park and stop development along the l street bluff which also sits on bootlegger cove clay but some town leaders feared anchorage would die if land was condemned the city was less than years old some residents did leave the week after the quake turning in their house keys to their lenders and condemning the land would hurt some of the city s most powerful property owners instead the city adopted plans to limit building height concentrate tall buildings on firmer ground in the core of downtown instead of its periphery that s why the atwood and conocophillips buildings are on seventh avenue and to adopt tough codes for areas expected to have unsteady ground an unsung cadre of engineers has protected us since reviewing plans and objecting when the danger is too high they have been overruled at times and anchorage has a few buildings that geotechnical engineers do not approve of but friday s lack of deaths and low number of serious injuries speaks to their success a magnitude earthquake in august killed people in indonesia and displaced in august of a quake killed people in central italy i would not blame anyone for those deaths many variables make those places different from alaska but it is worth noting that as alaskans we just survived something that easily could have killed many of us and we should learn from that the debate is not over endless meetings have weighed whether projects should go ahead when the experts have doubts cautious voices always face the excitement of jobs and economic growth the next time you hear about a developer who wants to build on view property along cook inlet on bootlegger cove clay think about that jolt you felt friday morning when a proposal comes forward to break the height limit or bend the geotechnical rules remember who kept us safe friday

singapore abolishes school exam rankings says learning is not competition whether a child finishes first or last will no longer be indicated in primary and secondary school report books from next year in singapore a move which education minister ong ye kung hopes will show students that learning is not a competition report books will not just stop showing a student s position in relation to class or cohort the information to be dropped includes class and level mean minimum and maximum marks underlining and or colouring of failing marks pass fail for end of year result mean subject grades overall total marks l r english plus five relevant subjects l r emb english maths best three subjects and emb for lower secondary levels the ministry of education moe said on friday sept that the change is to allow each student to focus on his or her learning progress and discourage them from being overly concerned about comparisons from next year all examinations for primary and pupils will also be removed and whatever forms of assessment they have will not count towards an overall grade the moe said that teachers will continue to gather information about pupils learning through discussions homework and quizzes schools will use other ways like qualitative descriptors in place of marks and grades to evaluate pupils progress at these two levels for older students in primary schools and secondary schools marks for each subject will be rounded off and presented as a whole number without decimal points to reduce the focus on academic scores parents will continue to receive information about their child s progress in school during parent teacher meetings in an address to some school leaders earlier this week mr ong said i know that coming in first or second in class or level has traditionally been a proud recognition of a student s achievement but removing these indicators is for a good reason so that the child understands from young that learning is not a competition but a self discipline they need to master for life notwithstanding the report book should still contain some form of yardstick and information to allow students to judge their relative performance and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses source straittimes,pos

supposedly extinct kangaroo rat resurfaces after years supposedly extinct kangaroo rat resurfaces after years the last time anyone saw the san quintin kangaroo rat was more than years ago in the arid scrublands of baja california in mexico mexican authorities declared the small mammal critically endangered and possibly extinct in so biologists couldn t believe their eyes when not one but four san quintin kangaroo rats dipodomys gravipes hopped into their survey traps in named for their ability to leap like kangaroos the rats are key species in arid areas across western north america dispersing seeds and feeding predators such as coyotes and foxes the san quintin kangaroo rat is about centimeters long with a long tufted tail and enormous hind legs that allow it to leap about meters and speed away at kilometers per hour they once lived by the thousands in a narrow coastal valley stretching kilometers along the pacific coast of northern baja california but their numbers began to dwindle with the introduction of intensive agriculture in the s after which their habitat and food disappeared then just months ago a team of researchers doing a routine inventory of mammals in the region discovered the rats in their survey traps none of them had ever seen the species before so they had to compare it with museum specimens and photographs they will report in an upcoming issue of the bulletin of the southern california academy of sciences the researchers attribute the kangaroo rat s comeback to a dramatic decrease in farming over the past decade thanks to drought related water shortages although the researchers are concerned that farmers may eventually make their own comeback they are optimistic that the san quintin kangaroo rat will persist as it has also shown up in a nearby nature reserve they say it also offers hope for other extinct small mammals which may be findable if only researchers take the time and effort to track them down,pos
holocaust hero us soldier told nazi captors we are all jews the nazi soldiers made their orders very clear jewish american prisoners of war were to be separated from their fellow brothers in arms and sent to an uncertain fate but master sgt roddie edmonds would have none of that as the highest ranking noncommissioned officer held in the german pow camp he ordered more than americans captives to step forward with him and brazenly pronounced we are all jews here he would not waver even with a pistol to his head and his captors eventually backed down seventy years later the knoxville tennessee native is being posthumously recognized with israel s highest honor for non jews who risked their lives to save jews during world war ii he s the first american serviceman to earn the honor master sgt roddie edmonds seemed like an ordinary american soldier but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings said avner shalev chairman of the yad vashem holocaust museum and memorial the choices and actions of master sgt edmonds set an example for his fellow american soldiers as they stood united against the barbaric evil of the nazis it s a story that remained untold for decades and one that his son the rev chris edmonds only discovered long after his father s death in edmonds was captured with thousands of others in the battle of the bulge in late and spent days in captivity his son vaguely knew about his father s past from a pair of diaries edmonds kept in captivity that included the names and addresses of his men and some of his daily thoughts but it was only while scouring the internet a few years ago that he began to unravel the true drama that had unfolded oddly enough when he read a newspaper article about richard nixon s post presidency search for a new york home as it happened nixon purchased his exclusive upper east side town house from lester tanner a prominent new york lawyer who mentioned in passing how edmonds had saved him and dozens of other jews during the war the new york times reported in as a g i in world war ii mr tanner had been taken prisoner by the germans and was being held in the ziegenhein stalag in january when the nazi commandant demanded at gunpoint to know which of the american soldiers were jews as mr tanner recalled it their brave officer master sgt roddie edmonds defied the camp commander saying the geneva convention forbade the request and mr tanner and his fellow prisoners were spared to be liberated shortly afterward that sparked a search for tanner who along with another jewish pow paul stern told the younger edmonds what they witnessed on jan at the stalag ixa pow camp near ziegenhain germany the wehrmacht had a strict anti jew policy and segregated jewish pows from non jews on the eastern front captured jewish soldiers in the russian army had been sent to extermination camps at the time of edmonds capture the most infamous nazi death camps were no longer fully operational so jewish american pows were instead sent to slave labor camps where their chances of survival were low u s soldiers had been warned that jewish fighters among them would be in danger if captured and were told to destroy dog tags or any other evidence identifying them as jewish so when the german camp commander speaking in english ordered the jews to identify themselves edmonds knew what was at stake turning to the rest of the pows he said we are not doing that we are all falling out recalled chris edmonds who is currently in israel participating in a seminar for christian leaders at yad vashem s international school for holocaust studies with all the camp s inmates defiantly standing in front of their barracks the german commander turned to edmonds and said they cannot all be jews to which edmonds replied we are all jews here then the nazi officer pressed his pistol to edmonds head and offered him one last chance edmonds merely gave him his name rank and serial number as required by the geneva conventions and then my dad said if you are going to shoot you are going to have to shoot all of us because we know who you are and you ll be tried for war crimes when we win this war recalled chris edmonds who estimates his father s actions saved the lives of more than jewish american soldiers witnesses to the exchange said the german officer then withdrew stern who currently lives in reston virginia told yad vashem that even years later he can still hear the words about million european jews were killed by german nazis and their collaborators during world war ii the names of those honored for risking their lives to protect jews are engraved along an avenue of trees at the jerusalem memorial more than have been designated righteous among the nations the most famous being oskar schindler whose efforts to save more than jews were documented in steven spielberg s film schindler s list and raoul wallenberg a swedish diplomat who is credited for having saved at least jews before mysteriously disappearing but prior to edmonds only four were americans who belonged to the clergy or volunteered for rescue groups he s the first serviceman and the first whose actions saved the lives of fellow americans a ceremony for edmonds is planned next year and thanks to his son s efforts edmonds is now also being considered for a congressional medal of honor irena steinfeldt the director of the holocaust memorial s righteous among the nations department said all rescue stories were unique she said edmonds actions were reflective of those of a military man who was prepared to take a quick clear moral decision it s a matter of five minutes and that is it when he tells the german no that is something that can kill him she explained it is something very dangerous that is happening in one moment but it is very heroic chris edmonds who leads a baptist congregation in maryville tennessee said he believed his father had a deep moral conviction instilled in his faith that inspired his actions all he had to fight with was his will power and his wits he said i m just glad he did the right thing get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your

the end of root canals stem cell fillings trigger teeth to repair themselves research study claims what if damaged teeth could heal themselves without the need of a root canal apparently that s what harvard and the university of nottingham are trying to figure out they believe they can create stem cell stimulated fillings worldwide dentists treat hundreds of millions of cavities each year by drilling out the decayed part of the tooth and replacing it with a filling according to popular science the problem is up to percent of those procedures will fail which will lead to a root canal to remove the tooth s pulp a soft tissue in the center of the tooth that contains blood vessels nerves and connective tissue the downside is following a root canal the tooth s strength is weaker and could eventually need to be removed adam celiz is a therapeutic biomaterials researcher who believes that stem cells could help reduce the number of root canals and the need for dentures celiz and his team developed a new kind of filling that is made from stem cells that can help your tooth heal just like regular fillings the biomaterial stem cells are injected into the tooth and hardened with ultra violet light existing dental fillings are toxic to cells and are therefore incompatible with pulp tissue inside the tooth in cases of dental pulp disease and injury a root canal is typically performed to remove the infected tissues we have designed synthetic biomaterials that can be used similarly to dental fillings but can be placed in direct contact with pulp tissue to stimulate the native stem cell population for repair and regeneration of pulp tissue and the surrounding dentin our approach has great promise to impact the dental field and this prize provides a great platform to develop this technology further with industrial partners celiz believes that all fillings could be made of such regenerative material so that damaged teeth could heal themselves which in theory would reduce the filling failures and could completely eliminate the need for root canals the researchers believe that if used on a damaged tooth those stem cells can repair the tooth it would mimic a filling but would have a very low risk of rejection or failure the easiest way to explain it is the tooth would heal itself with the help of the stem cell biomaterial injection according to daily mail the research placed second in the materials category of the royal society of chemistry s emerging technologies competition in applications were judged on the degree of innovation the potential impact and the quality of the science behind it many dentists aren t sure if stem cells have a place in dentistry they suggest additional research to prove or disprove its benefits,pos

been full he says and he d have been in water for as long as there was daylight the deserted beach in piha new zealand which is normally filled with surfers for five weeks most forms of recreation including swimming were illegal luke darby it was an interesting call to make to actually make surfing criminal he said but with the end of the prohibition on surfing and many other activities now just days away wallis says he feels the gains in new zealand probably made the ban worthwhile we may be able to open new zealand back up if we can crush this he said of the government s stated goal of eradicating the infection eradicate covid on monday prime minister jacinda ardern announced that what new zealand calls its alert level measures the most intense level would last until end of day april after which the country will revert to alert level a level with greater freedoms advertisement we have done what few countries have been able to do we have stopped a wave of devastation said ardern who has received widespread praise both at home and abroad for taking early decisive action against covid the number of cases that each person with the virus passes it on to is now less than half a person each overseas the average is people so we have among the lowest number of confirmed cases per people in the world as of tuesday the country of five million people had registered cases and just deaths most of them in nursing homes the majority of those infected have also now recovered new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern speaks to media march we have done what few countries have been able to do we have stopped a wave of devastation she said april martin hunter reuters for much of march and april under the alert level lockdown only essential trips to the grocery store and pharmacies were permitted along with brief trips outside for exercise swimming at the beach and surfing were not designated as essential activities and related businesses closed advertisement stringent measures the measures in place since march go significantly beyond what most canadian provinces have brought in in british columbia for example restaurants have been serving takeout food many public parks and beaches have remained open organizations such as amazon and canada post have been making deliveries and some retailers have been able to continue with in store sales as long as they abide by physical distancing guidelines whereas most countries have focused on flattening the curve of cases to ensure health care systems aren t overwhelmed at the peak of infections new zealand s government decided early on it would go a big step further and try to wipe out covid completely siouxsie wiles is a microbiologist and associate professor at the university of auckland chris brown skype it s only a viable strategy if you do it early enough it becomes harder to do it the longer you leave it said siouxsie wiles an infectious disease expert at the university of auckland wiles with striking bright pink hair and an easy way of communicating difficult concepts has become something of a national celebrity since the beginning of the epidemic with near daily appearances on local media measles outbreak in an interview with cbc news she said one of the key considerations for ardern s government in adopting the strictest measures possible was the interconnectedness the country has with many small pacific islands that were in an extremely poor position to fight covid advertisement we saw last year in samoa when we exported measles how absolutely devastating it was to them they just don t have the health care system we have show more andrew chang asks an infectious disease doctor whether it s safer to be indoors or outdoors during the coronavirus pandemic in the small nation in the south pacific registered almost cases of measles resulting in deaths scientists believe the disease was carried there by an infected patient who arrived on an air new zealand flight after april wiles says the plan is to keep new zealand s borders closed to international travellers and to carefully track every new covid case that turns up seeking out and isolating anyone who had contact with the infected person if your contact tracing and testing is good enough then you can minimize outbreaks you can find cases and stop that spread the surfing community of piha on new zealand s north island is a ghost town after an intense one month lockdown luke darby while new zealand health officials have not released the raw data on their capacity to contact trace several independent experts brought in as consultants have agreed with the ardern government s approach and that new zealand is in a position to make contact tracing work advertisement incomplete data opposition politicians however insist the lockdown could have ended even sooner if the government had been more forthright about its ability to monitor the spread of the virus this is a real shame as businesses will suffer further damage and that will lead to poor health outcomes as a result of the huge stress this will cause for a lot of people said opposition national party leader simon bridges practically speaking alert level will leave new zealanders freer than canadians in some ways but not in others people will be able to extend their bubble as health officials refer to it by having caregivers or cleaners return to their homes for example as long as those workers don t also visit other homes schools will open for elementary and middle school students but the expectation is that any student who is in a position to continue with online learning from home will do so advertisement wallis is ready to get back in the water having been beached for the past month because of covid luke darby industries such as construction and forestry will be allowed to resume restaurants will not be able to open up for table service but takeout will be permitted and people will be able to head to the beach again to surf relapse possible after two weeks if there is no covid relapse the prime minister said the nation could move down to alert level by the middle of may which would permit even greater freedoms taiwan and south korea have had similar success to new zealand s in cornering the virus though singapore which was also seen as a textbook case is now experiencing a dramatic second wave of infections after initially relaxing its prohibitions wiles says it is still too soon to know when international flights will resume to new zealand but she says she expects the first steps may be to resume flying to other nations such as taiwan or those in the south pacific that have also virtually wiped out the infection we may end up having countries around the world that are these little islands that you could travel between she said advertisement going forward it s an interesting thing how you maintain a virus free status all of that is heartening news for zen wallis who is planning to be back in the water first thing once the surf ban is lifted i m psyched up i am getting ready now he said still after that instant rush he says he worries about how long it will take his business

i never saw stars before gene therapy brings back year old canadian boy s sight toronto for the thousands of canadians at risk of blindness eight year old sam is a beacon of hope he is the first canadian to be treated with gene replacement therapy for a rare form of blindness which had left sam unable to see sky on a cloudy day and unable to make out shapes in the dark sometimes you have to walk in the night and i couldn t see things and you bump into things sam told ctv news he had to have lights on always and had trouble seeing his shoes or objects on the floor and the condition was progressive meaning things would get worse as he grew older a daunting prospect when there was no treatment available but now he can see cloudy skies shoes and more the best part of his improved vision says sam are the stars at night i never saw stars before he said and i also never saw airplanes flying at night he was diagnosed after birth with a genetic disorder called retinitis pigmentosa a form of genetic retinal degeneration resulting from mutations in the rpe gene you lose perception of light dr elise heon of sick kids hospital explained to ctv news you end up in darkness and it s slowly progressive it s relentless your visual field shrinks and shrinks and shrinks and shrinks retinitis pigmentosa rp affects between in to in canadians according to fighting blindness canada it actually refers to a group of disorders as there are numerous versions of rp depending on which pair of genes are damaged more than genes have been identified by scientists as potentially having mutations that cause rp now canada has approved the first ever gene replacement therapy for this form of blindness sick kids hospital has children in its program with this mutation the drug can be used on children and adults with the condition but the earlier it s used the more sight it will save doctors believe it s a huge deal because for these patients before there s no treatments heon said she said she had recently met two patients brothers who were suffering the same problem as sam and for the first time she was able to provide hope they re years old and they re losing their vision she said if we do nothing they re just going fine they ll just end up with no light reception so for the first time we were able to say well actually we need to have a discussion and it was just it was priceless the gene therapy which goes by the brand name luxturna was developed in the u s by the drug company spark therapeutics it works by placing a copy of the healthy gene into inactivated viruses which are then injected into the retina the gene then allows cells to produce the necessary protein to convert light into an electrical signal in the retina in order to provide healthy vision and prevent progression of the disease it is the first targeted gene therapy to be approved by health canada which gave it the all clear this week back in sam and his family travelled to the u s to get the new gene therapy because it wasn t available in canada yet his mother sarah banon noticed changes quickly about a week later i noticed he could get dressed by himself she said he could get his shoes on by himself independently his improvements have continued in the year since he first received the gene therapy he is so much more confident his mother told ctv news like getting dressed by himself matching clothes doesn t have to have things enlarged being able to see even when it s dark outside no lights on and it is a cloudy day he would have to at school keep the lights on now he is able to function as a normal child with the approval of this gene therapy in canada doctors are hoping to be able to use it on more patients who qualify and the earlier the better dr peter kertes a vitreo retinal surgeon and ophthalmologist in chief at sunnybrook health sciences centre told ctv news that the approval of the therapy is fantastic this is a huge breakthrough he said most of the advances that we have in medicine are incremental every once in a while once in a generation something revolutionary like this comes along that really changes the course of therapy luxturna specifically treats individuals with biallelic mutations of the rpe gene meaning they have mutations in that gene stemming from both parents which manifests as either rp or leber congenital amaurosis lca it s a very small patient group compared to the entirety of canadians with inherited retinal diseases this may be just one gene therapy for one condition but it will open to the door to this strategy being used in other scenarios kertes pointed out this is the tip of the iceberg i think this is a vector that will prove to be very effective and holds great promise he said i think many people who are living with blindness or facing blindness have much to look forward to i think we re on the cusp of a revolution in this group of diseases the company licensing the therapy novartis pharmaceuticals canada inc isn t detailing the cost but based on the price in the u s it could top million in canada making it among the most expensive drugs in the country the therapy is currently under review by both the canadian agency for drugs and technologies in health cadth and the institut national d excellence en sant et en services sociaux inesss novartis said in a statement that they look forward to receiving their recommendations following health canada s approval they said they are eager to help eligible canadians affected by this rare disease gain access to the first ever gene replacement therapy as quickly as possible the patented medicine prices review board will be disclosing their new guidelines in terms of capping drug prices in an online media briefing this thursday as this will likely be the first of many gene replacement therapies with similarly high price tags ottawa and the provinces will have to make the decision on whether it will be covered by provincial health plans the question is an ongoing ethical debate with some saying that drug companies will only take advantage of it if governments show that they are willing to pay should it be the responsibility for the government to pay for any drug at any price marc andr gagnon a researcher with carleton university who looks into pharmaceutical policy told ctv news the problem is if we say yes to this question you can be sure that the day after all the drugs in the market will be asking for much higher prices it s a very expensive drug heon acknowledged however she pointed out that this is a rare disease and it s not a recurrent treatment it s a one time injection to the eyes you treat both eyes and then that s it she said to be able to change someone s life is quite a privilege and to be able to prevent someone from going blind is a real privilege for sam and his mother the gift of independence has been priceless this is a story of hope his mother said a child told it is what it is and now when he looks up at night he can see stars,pos
new zealand wants to make people happy not rich will it work new zealand s priorities are changing rex shutterstock new zealand s latest budget unveiled this week is being touted as the first in a western country to put well being over economic pressures the country s prime minister jacinda ardern promised billions of dollars in additional funds to address mental health problems suicide and child poverty almost nz billion is earmarked for mental health services following yet another year of the country having the highest teen and young adult suicide rates in western countries advertisement as well as boosting existing mental health services more money will be used to help people with mild or moderate mental health issues before they become an emergency almost nz million will go to an initiative to provide long term shelter for people who are homeless with no strings attached and more than nz billion to addressing child poverty today we have laid the foundation for not just one well being budget but a different approach for government decision making altogether ardern said while unveiling her budget the goal is to downplay the importance of gross domestic product gdp a measurement of country s economic activity that is normally seen as a key indicator of success but despite what ardern and her team suggest no budgets are solely about gdp all budgets in pretty much all developed countries are well being budgets says arthur grimes of the motu economic and public policy research trust new zealand he notes that the definition of well being is welfare and virtually every budget allocates money to services such as poverty mental health and housing grimes is also sceptical about how well being will be measured with around different indicators proposed in my view that s a really scattergun approach he says child poverty is the only metric being tracked he says making it difficult to assess whether the budget will achieve what it is designed to do one way of tracking well being is to ask people how they rate their lives overall but a limitation is that it might take several years for policies to shift the population s aggregated well being up or down compared to other countries beyond the short time frame politicians operate in nevertheless the government could still use these self reported questionnaires to assess specific interventions for example someone s well being before and after they move into public housing grimes suggests new zealand is actually not the first country to prioritise well being the kingdom of bhutan has discussed the need to value happiness over economic growth since the s and made it official with its gross national happiness index in the french launched a well being framework following a report commissioned by then president nicholas sarkozy that led to ongoing tracking of new indicators of wealth these include poverty education healthy life expectancy income inequality and carbon footprint the uk also had a short lived attempt at bringing well being to the forefront under former prime minister david cameron while it hasn t overtaken gdp in budget discussions the uk s office for national statistics continues to track well being giving useful insights into the population s life satisfaction happiness employment levels and more perhaps the key difference is that new zealand says it is placing well being at the heart of the budget it might take many years for the machinery of government to come around to it but the reframing of a country s success could start there,pos
beaumont texas in a city with no water two men get coca cola s permission to steal it in a city with no water here is a list of items required to break into a warehouse and steal cases of bottled water one hand saw one hammer one hovercraft capable of zinging over the flooded streets of beaumont texas at miles an hour oh and permission from the coca cola company fortunately bill zang recently found himself equipped with all four things at a few minutes after p m on saturday he killed the hovercraft s engines and floated toward the coca cola warehouse on the northern edge of beaumont at the back gate zang hacked the lock with a saw then his friend sam byers slammed the lock with a hammer the lock broke the gate swung wide both men laughed this is so much fun said byers happy finally to find water in beaumont where the water treatment plant had been offline for two days story continues after this collection of harvey video reports a week after hurricane harvey made landfall most of the rescue and recovery efforts in south texas are no fun at all the work is simultaneously plodding and emotionally charged relief workers spend days floating through flooded neighborhoods checking and rechecking houses to make sure all the people and pets have been evacuated sometimes they rescue a cat sometimes they discover a corpse sometimes they find nothing but flooded homes and silence at this point as the adrenaline of early rescue efforts fades into fatigue many rescuers find the inertia of routine becomes their primary fuel i have no idea when we got here said zang president of the hovercraft unlimited company who drove from his home in rockport illinois with two hovercraft to help rescue hurricane victims what was that two days ago four the days all start running together after a while hurricane harvey help from n j arrives for hospital workers in houston aftermath as houston reels post harvey moonachie rebuilding years after sandy sometimes however the routines get scrambled and relief workers get the opportunity to do something they will remember for the rest of their lives their stories serve as a reminder that even though the sky over south texas has brightened and the nation s attention has begun to move on with the rain thousands of people are still in desperate need of help there is still a lot of work to do zang said for edwin toy the break in the monotony came thursday night when he was the lead driver of a truck convoy delivering bottled water from houston to beaumont the trip normally takes about an hour and a half toy said on thursday it took hours toy sat in the cab of his truck with water lapping halfway up his gas tank we just had to get through said toy a driver for the h e b grocery company i don t think i ll ever forget it for cassidy meeks the adrenaline came from running up and down u s route northeast of beaumont looking for people to save at p m on saturday meeks met a woman at a nearby shell gas station who said her brother was trapped on the highway by water rushing from the flooded pine island bayou meeks didn t have any special gear at her disposal she simply started walking she went north as far as she could hugging the highway s concrete median for support as the water rose to her neck finally she turned around and flagged down zang aboard his bright blue hovercraft he s out there somewhere but i can t find him meeks of joshua texas told zang we ve got to find him it sounds like he s about to drown zang was not excited about the mission the current was moving at about miles an hour he said and one mistake could drown both himself and the man he was trying to save he roared off anyway sending a plume of spray behind his craft s main propeller seven minutes later zang returned with cory adams looking wet and sheepish sitting in the backseat he was in the nasty part of the water flow said zang if you fall in there you re swept away for miles and nobody will ever find you no one else in the vicinity had a boat powerful enough to even get close to adams however he had been in the torrent for an hour he said and he was losing strength i thought i was going to drown said adams if he didn t come and save me there s no way i would have made it compared with most of his rescue missions after hurricane harvey zang s effort to remove water from the coca cola warehouse was a bit of a lark someone with the coca cola company informed beaumont s fire department that the facility contained thousands of bottles of fresh water but flooding in and around the building prevented people in most vehicles from entering and retrieving it the firefighters asked zang if he could help he said and so he and byers found themselves standing behind the coca cola warehouse a few minutes after p m after entering the gate they motored to the building where byers broke a window with a hammer reached inside and pulled a door open inside they found tens of thousands of bottles of fanta dr pepper coca cola and dasani brand bottled water they loaded cases of water onto the hovercraft s flat deck powered up and sped away the cases later would be picked up by other volunteers and delivered to national guard troops who would distribute them to harvey evacuees garden state of mind a night at the vince garden state of mind rescued from heat puppies raise specter of smuggling garden state of mind you

a small city in iowa is devoting acres of land to america s vanishing bees a bee visits a flower geoffrey fairchild via flickr cc by you ve probably heard the news that our nation s bees are in trouble pollinators have been disappearing for decades and the population crash could threaten the global food supply now a small city in iowa has decided to do something about it this spring cedar rapids population will seed acres with native prairie grasses and wildflowers the city s plan is to eventually create acres of bee paradise by planting these pollinator friendly foodstuffs scientists think the pollinator crisis is caused by a variety of factors including pesticides pathogens and climate change meanwhile with farms parking lots mowed lawns and other human developments replacing wildflower fields bees have been losing habitat and their food supply while many of the drivers behind bee population decline remain mysterious the people of cedar rapids hope to at least give pollinators places to perch and plants to feed on the acre pollinator initiative grew out of a partnership with the monarch research project mrp whose goal is to restore monarch butterfly populations it was cedar rapids park superintendent daniel gibbins who proposed converting acres into pollinator habitat over five years so far the project has secured in funding from the state and the mrp with the agricultural boom around years ago about percent of all the native habitat of iowa has been lost says gibbins who is spearheading the project when you convert it back to what was originally native iowa you re going to help a lot more than just native pollinators you re helping birds amphibians reptiles mammals everything that s native here relies on native vegetation prairie revival cedar rapids has developed a special mix of grasses and wildflowers to help restore that native habitat the seed mix includes species of wildflowers and species of native prairie grasses while bees and butterflies are mostly attracted to the flowers the hardy prairie grasses will prevent weeds and invasive species from moving in and choking out the flowers gibbins and his team have catalogued all the unused public land where they could potentially plant the flowers and grasses the list includes not only the rarely frequented corners of parks golf courses and the local airport but also sewage ditches water retention basins and roadway right of ways totaling nearly acres cedar rapids is working with other cities within the county to reach its acre target restoring native wildflowers and prairies grasses will help iowa s bees and butterflies as well as other native animals cedar rapids parks and recreation before they can seed the land with the special pollinator plant mix gibbins crew has to knock back the undesirable vegetation that means mowing down burning off or in some cases applying herbicide to get rid of grass weeds and invasive species they ll lay down the special seed mixture in the spring and fall you can t just seed them and walk away says gibbins although the pollinator habitat will be lower maintenance than a green turf that needs to be mown every week the prairie grasses will require some care including mowing once a year or burning every few years everyone can help you don t need to have spare acres to help bees and butterflies even devoting a few square feet of your garden or even a few small planters to wildflowers native to your area could make a difference says gibbins when creating pollinator gardens the most important thing is to have a big diversity of wildflowers and heirloom crops that bloom in the spring summer and fall says stephen buchmann a pollination ecologist at the university of arizona and author of the reason for flowers buchmann isn t involved in the acre initiative buchmann recommends against using herbicides or insecticides or if necessary applying them at night when bees aren t active providing nesting sites for certain bee species can help too people think they ll just plant the wildflowers and the bees will come he says and that s true in some cases but the smaller the bee is the less far it can fly some can only fly a few hundred meters some species nest in hard substrates like the bare ground bees hate mulch says buchmann or in holes that you can drill in adobe or earthen bricks others nestle in sand pits or dead wood that s been tunneled through by beetles and it helps to have mud and water on the premises the xerces society has a handy how to guide on creating homes for bees the acre pollinator initiative is still looking into funding for the next four years and they don t expect to see huge jumps in the number of pollinators immediately but cedar rapids is confident it will help and they hope the project will serve as a model for the rest of the country and if enough local businesses and private landowners get involved there s no reason to stop at acres says gibbins there s a big push to extend this initiative up to maybe acres in linn county,pos

homeless people in california western states cannot be prosecuted for sleeping outside if shelter access is lacking court rules prosecuting homeless people for sleeping on public property when they have no access to shelter violates the constitution s ban on cruel and unusual punishment a federal appeals court decided tuesday the u s th circuit court of appeals unanimously overturned a district court decision in favor of the city of boise idaho in a case in which homeless people challenged two city ordinances that barred them from staying overnight on public property the ruling will protect the homeless not only in boise but in california and other western states from ordinances that punish them for being unable to obtain shelter the challengers who had been cited under the boise ordinances sought damages and a court order barring the city from enforcing the laws advertisement after the litigation began the boise police department decided in to prohibit enforcement of the ordinances against any homeless person on public property on a night when no shelter had an available overnight space police continued to cite homeless people on nights when there was availability in the shelters the th circuit though cited evidence that some shelters limited the number of days a homeless person could stay or turned away people who arrived past certain hours others required a religious commitment the court said a city cannot via the threat of prosecution coerce an individual to attend religion based treatment programs judge marsha s berzon wrote for the court even though the shelters had beds some homeless people did not have access to them the court noted tuesday s decision reinstated a th circuit ruling in a challenge to a los angeles homeless law a settlement was eventually reached in the los angeles case and the ruling lost its value as a precedent the panel hearing the boise challenge said it agreed with the ruling in the los angeles case and reiterated that the homeless may not be held criminally responsible for sleeping on government property when no alternative shelter was available advertisement the th amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting sleeping or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter berzon wrote the court said its holding was narrow it does not require a city to allow anyone on public property at any time or mandate that cities provide adequate shelter rather the court said as long as there is no option of sleeping indoors the government cannot criminalize indigent homeless people for sleeping outdoors on public property on the false premise they had a choice in the matter in a partial dissent judge john b owens wrote that he agreed with most of the ruling but would have limited some of the plaintiffs claims advertisement maura dolan latimes com twitter mauradolan,pos

former slave two time olympian becomes an airman after enduring countless hardships and overcoming unimaginable obstacles airman st class guor maker a dental assistant currently in technical training found his way out of war torn south sudan africa and into the u s nearly years ago surviving as one of roughly children uprooted by the gruesome second sudanese civil war maker s childhood was far from normal after losing family members including eight of his nine siblings year old maker set out on foot from south sudan to live with his uncle the country i came from was torn apart by war said maker it was all i knew growing up nothing else i ve seen people die in front of me but i knew no matter what i had to make it during his harrowing journey maker was captured and enslaved twice once by sudanese soldiers and once by herdsmen when i was captured i was forced to be a slave laborer said maker i would wash dishes or do anything else needed to get by i slept in a small cell and rarely got to eat but not always both times maker successfully escaped from enslavement and was finally able to join his uncle in khartoum after three perilous years however his journey to safety was far from over during a nighttime attack on the perceived safety of his uncle s home maker sustained serious injuries when he was beaten unconscious by a soldier who smashed his jaw with a rifle my mouth was shut for two months and i could only consume liquids because my jaw was broken he said we fled to egypt after that and the united nations treated my injuries after two years of filling out paperwork at u s citizenship and immigration services in egypt maker and his uncle s family were finally granted permission to enter the united states i was very excited to come to the u s said maker looking back at everything my family and i endured it is a miracle that we made it out of there gour maker stands in formation at the coin ceremony feb outside the pfingston reception center at joint base san antonio lackland texas u s air force dillon parker dreaming when maker first arrived in the u s in he settled in concord new hampshire not only did he want to survive but he wanted to thrive i wanted to change my life help my parents back in south sudan and give my future children a better childhood than the one i had he said and the only way to do that was through education and determination maker started with the basics and began learning english by watching children s cartoons and spending plenty of time with other high school kids just listening to their conversations and absorbing all that he could within a short amount of time i was able to communicate with effectively with other students and teachers order food and really get by on my own maker said while learning english was a crucial step on his personal journey maker s high school career really took off when one of his teachers introduced him to running running was always just natural and easy for me said maker it was a great high school experience and it helped me meet a lot of friends build confidence and it was genuinely fun after winning the national high school indoor two mile title maker received a scholarship to compete at iowa state university where he allowed himself to dream of things that had never been done before when i got to college in i remember hanging a piece of paper on my wall that said i was going to run in the olympics in for south sudan said maker i thought why not me why can t i do it maker graduated with a bachelor s degree in chemistry and reached all american status as a student athlete ready to start his new life maker planned to head to flagstaff arizona to train for the olympics the same day he left for arizona in was the day south sudan officially gained its independence i drove the whole way celebrating and it was a very special day that i will always remember said maker following his year of training maker qualified to run the marathon in the olympics in london even though south sudan officially gained its independence the country was not yet a member of the international olympic committee and maker was still not an official u s citizen state senators from new hampshire and arizona presented my case to the senate in washington d c so the international olympic committee allowed me to run in the olympics without a country said maker even though his dream of running for south sudan had not yet come true maker accomplished a great deal as an unaffiliated olympian all of the people in south sudan knew where i was from said maker i wanted to be the inspiration for the children to say hey if maker can do it you know what i can do it too after the olympics maker was undeterred and set a new goal for himself and his country i said to myself in i m going to bring south sudan to the olympics for the first time said maker i wanted to try to do more for my country and the olympics only strengthened my conviction to accomplish my goal this time around maker s dream became a reality in rio de janeiro when he became one of three athletes to be the first to represent south sudan in an olympic games as well as south sudan s flag bearer for the opening ceremony walking into that stadium carrying the south sudan flag was just indescribable said maker the people of south sudan were in my mind the whole time i was running into the stadium with that flag and it meant so much to me while it was a truly incredible and improbable moment for maker his thoughts were filled with the people of his home country while he was running with that flag over years of civil war and my country finally got independence said maker so many lives were lost for our freedom it was just ringing in my head that we have done it we have done it on that day everyone in south sudan was at peace watching the olympics for the first time the olympics were an enormous accomplishment for the former slave and south sudan native that went far beyond his nd overall finish i couldn t have accomplished any of it without all the support i received from my family and the opportunity the united states gave me it s the highlight of my athletic career so far and a moment i ll treasure forever serving the next chapter in maker s life began when he decided to join the u s air force to serve the country that gave him so many opportunities all of the things i ve accomplished have derived from the opportunities the u s has afforded me said maker when i first came to america i didn t have hardly anything but with the support and opportunity this country has given me i ve been able to completely change my life the staff at basic military training had no idea who maker was but he quickly stood out to leadership at the th training squadron i went out to the track and saw the instructors were putting their attention on one trainee in particular said maj john lippolis director of operations for the th trs i could see him running noticeably faster than everyone else and the instructors explained to me that we had a two time olympian at bmt in addition to maker s olympian status his unique personal story also stood out lippolis i was just absolutely floored when i talked to him about what he went through to get to where he is today said lippolis not only did he get survive he wanted to better himself and he has accomplished so much he has an amazing story and the drive he has displayed to succeed like that in the face of such adversity is truly inspiring maker not only inspired lippolis but other members of his flight were inspired too all of his wingmen said the same things when i talked to them said lippolis they told me what an inspiration he was within the flight that the flight rallied around him and he doesn t do anything he s supposed to do for himself until he helps out everybody else while maker has accomplished a great deal in his lifetime he s not done dreaming maker hopes to join the air force world class athlete program a program designed to allow elite athletes the opportunity to train and compete in national events to make the olympics he also wants to make the olympics where he ll have the opportunity to

land president bachelet signs unprecedented measure into law jonathan franklin in valle chacabuco franklinblog mon jan gmt share on facebook share on twitter share via email years old chile has created five sprawling national parks to preserve vast tracts of patagonia the culmination of more than two decades of land acquisition by the us philanthropists doug tompkins and kristine mcdivitt tompkins and the largest donation of private land to government in south america the five parks spanning m acres were signed into law on monday by chile s president michelle bachelet launching a new park route that stretches down the southern spine of chile to cape horn show more mcdivitt tompkins the former chief executive of the outdoors company patagonia handed over m acres to help create the new parks the chilean government provided the rest in federally controlled land mcdivitt tompkins has spent years working on land conservation in chile with her late husband doug who founded north face and esprit doug tompkins died in a kayaking accident in chile in this is not just an unprecedented act of preservation said bachelet who flew to this remote patagonian valley on monday to receive the donation it is an invitation to imagine other forms to use our land to use natural resources in a way that does not destroy them to have sustainable development the only profitable economic development in the long term the creation of the parks marks the latest in a flurry of environmental protection laws which have brought chile to the forefront of worldwide conservation efforts last month bachelet who leaves office in march completed a five year negotiation with residents of easter island to form one of the world s largest marine protected areas which will protect some sq km of the pacific ocean president bachelet is leaving behind a bold legacy of environmental protection said maximiliano bello an advisor to the pew bertarelli ocean legacy program this is more impressive because chile is still a developing country with a long history of development and exploitation of resources in most cases over exploitation if chile can take these huge environmental steps there are few reasons why developed nations can t act as well after moving to chile from california in the early s the tompkinses spent hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and rewild swaths of land the approach hasn t been without controversy some locals bristled at what they considered a clumsy american land grab loggers and ranchers complained that valuable land was taken and the couple were also criticized for successfully agitating to prevent a huge hydroelectric scheme relations have improved in recent years with the handover of hundreds of thousands of acres to the chilean national park service mcdivitt tompkins has touted the ecotourism potential of a region of stunning beauty with glaciated fjords roaring rivers snow capped mountains and coastal volcanoes in the windswept valle chacabuco the couple transformed a rundown sheep ranch into the world class parque patagonia first they removed an estimated sheep then removed miles of fencing and retrained former ranch workers as conservation workers all of us who love the earth can see how the threats to wild places and creatures are growing said tompkins this is crucial work it s the work we ve been doing for decades argentine s centre right president mauricio macri has praised the tompkins model of conservation which preserves wild land while bringing in tourists and related business to try to promote sustainable local development in december macri accepted a donation of approximately acres from the conservation land trust and mcdivitt tompkins and announced his support for the planned iber national park a million acre wetland that is home to hundreds of bird species giant anteaters and wild macaw parrots and includes a breeding program to re introduce jaguars but opposition to conservation efforts remains strong in chile s controversial farmed salmon industry which has been fighting efforts for greater regulation last year local ranchers briefly occupied one of the tompkins parks in protest against what they see as the removal of productive lands from the local economy patricio ulloa the mayor of cochrane the closest town to parque patagonia rejected an invitation to the launch of the new park they have erased our history and there is no pardoning that he said that s what we who were born and raised in this land of pioneers feel they have never shown any evaluation that truly shows how this is going to benefit the community president bachelet s conservation measures are one part of her progressive legacy that is likely to survive the country s looming change of government incoming president sebastian pi era a billionaire businessman supported by an extreme rightwing coalition has indicated his intention to reverse efforts to loosen the country s draconian abortion laws and provide free university education to more students but he is a keen supporter of the tompkins conservation model in pi era purchased an estimated acres of wild lands on the chilean island of chiloe which he converted into parque tantauco inspired he said by the tompkins example,pos

drug reverses age related mental decline within days a cryo electron microscope rendering of an isrib molecule image by the adam frost lab just a few doses of an experimental drug can reverse age related declines in memory and mental flexibility in mice according to a new study by uc san francisco scientists the drug called isrib has already been shown in laboratory studies to restore memory function months after traumatic brain injury tbi reverse cognitive impairments in down syndrome prevent noise related hearing loss fight certain types of prostate cancer and even enhance cognition in healthy animals in the new study published dec in the open access journal elife researchers showed rapid restoration of youthful cognitive abilities in aged mice accompanied by a rejuvenation of brain and immune cells that could help explain improvements in brain function isrib s extremely rapid effects show for the first time that a significant component of age related cognitive losses may be caused by a kind of reversible physiological blockage rather than more permanent degradation said susanna rosi phd lewis and ruth cozen chair ii and professor in the departments of neurological surgery and of physical therapy and rehabilitation science the data suggest that the aged brain has not permanently lost essential cognitive capacities as was commonly assumed but rather that these cognitive resources are still there but have been somehow blocked trapped by a vicious cycle of cellular stress added peter walter phd a professor in the ucsf department of biochemistry and biophysics and a howard hughes medical institute investigator our work with isrib demonstrates a way to break that cycle and restore cognitive abilities that had become walled off over time could rebooting cellular protein production hold the key to aging and other diseases walter has won numerous scientific awards including the breakthrough lasker and shaw prizes for his decades long studies of cellular stress responses isrib discovered in in walter s lab works by rebooting cells protein production machinery after it gets throttled by one of these stress responses a cellular quality control mechanism called the integrated stress response isr isrib stands for isr inhibitor peter walter phd photo by elisabeth fall the isr normally detects problems with protein production in a cell a potential sign of viral infection or cancer promoting gene mutations and responds by putting the brakes on cell s protein synthesis machinery this safety mechanism is critical for weeding out misbehaving cells but if stuck in the on position in a tissue like the brain it can lead to serious problems as cells lose the ability to perform their normal activities walter and colleagues have found in particular recent animal studies by walter and rosi made possible by early philanthropic support from the rogers family foundation have implicated chronic isr activation in the persistent cognitive and behavioral deficits seen in patients after tbi by showing that in mice brief isrib treatment can reboot the isr and restore normal brain function almost overnight the cognitive deficits in tbi patients are often likened to premature aging which led rosi and walter to wonder if the isr could also underlie purely age related cognitive decline aging is well known to compromise cellular protein production across the body as life s many insults pile up and stressors like chronic inflammation wear away at cells potentially leading to widespread activation of the isr we ve seen how isrib restores cognition in animals with traumatic brain injury which in many ways is like a sped up version of age related cognitive decline said rosi who is director of neurocognitive research in the ucsf brain and spinal injury center and a member of the ucsf weill institute for neurosciences it may seem like a crazy idea but asking whether the drug could reverse symptoms of aging itself was just a logical next step improves cognition boosts neuron and immune cell function in the new study researchers led by rosi lab postdoc karen krukowski phd trained aged animals to escape from a watery maze by finding a hidden platform a task that is typically hard for older animals to learn but animals who received small daily doses of isrib during the three day training process were able to accomplish the task as well as youthful mice much better than animals of the same age who didn t receive the drug the researchers then tested how long this cognitive rejuvenation lasted and whether it could generalize to other cognitive skills several weeks after the initial isrib treatment they trained the same mice to find their way out of a maze whose exit changed daily a test of mental flexibility for aged mice who like humans tend to get increasingly stuck in their ways the mice who had received brief isrib treatment three weeks before still performed at youthful levels while untreated mice continued to struggle to understand how isrib might be improving brain function the researchers studied the activity and anatomy of cells in the hippocampus a brain region with a key role in learning and memory just one day after giving animals a single dose of isrib they found that common signatures of neuronal aging disappeared literally overnight neurons electrical activity became more sprightly and responsive to stimulation and cells showed more robust connectivity with cells around them while also showing an ability to form stable connections with one another usually only seen in younger mice susanna rosi phd photo by susan merrell the researchers are continuing to study exactly how the isr disrupts cognition in aging and other conditions and to understand how long isrib s cognitive benefits may last among other puzzles raised by the new findings is the discovery that isrib also alters the function of the immune system s t cells which also are prone to age related dysfunction the findings suggest another path by which the drug could be improving cognition in aged animals and could have implications for diseases from alzheimer s to diabetes that have been linked to heightened inflammation caused by an aging immune system this was very exciting to me because we know that aging has a profound and persistent effect on t cells and that these changes can affect brain function in the hippocampus said rosi at the moment this is just an interesting observation but it gives us a very exciting set of biological puzzles to solve broad effects exemplify serendipity of basic research rosi and walter were introduced by neuroscientist regis kelly phd executive director of the university of california s qb biotech innovation hub following walter s study showing that the drug seemed to instantly enhance cognitive abilities in healthy mice to rosi the results from that study implied some walled off cognitive potential in the brain that the molecule was somehow unlocking and she wondered if this extra cognitive boost might benefit patients with neurological damage from traumatic brain injury remove this text and use the embed button to add an image isrib s wide ranging implications chronic isr activation and resulting blockage of cellular protein production may play a role in a surprisingly wide array of neurological conditions here are the conditions where there is already evidence that the isr plays a role and which could potentially be treated with an isr resetting agent like isrib frontotemporal dementia alzheimer s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als age related cognitive decline multiple sclerosis traumatic brain injury parkinson s disease down syndrome vanishing white matter disorder prion disease see a recent review by walter and colleague mauro costa mattioli of baylor college of medicine in houston the labs joined forces to study the question in mice and were astounded by what they found isrib didn t just make up for some of the cognitive deficits in mice with traumatic brain injury it erased them this had never been seen before rosi said the mantra in the field was that brain damage is permanent irreversible how could a single treatment with a small molecule make them disappear overnight further studies demonstrated that neurons throughout the brains of animals with traumatic brain injury are thoroughly jammed up by the isr using isrib to release those brakes lets brain cells immediately get back to their normal business more recently studies in animals with very mild repetitive brain injury akin to pro athletes who experience many mild concussions over many years showed that isrib could reverse increased risk taking behavior associated with damage to self control circuits in the frontal cortex added to this karen s new results in aging mice are just amazing it s not often that you find a drug candidate that shows so much potential and promise walter added this project also shows the power of the ucsf community susanna and i didn t know each other and were living in different worlds until regis kelly brought us together making this powerful connection that neither of us had realized before amazing breakthroughs like this need more than the brilliance and experimental skills of susanna and peter said kelly they also need donors like the rogers family foundation willing to bridge the gap between great basic research and products that could be highly beneficial to society isrib has been licensed by calico a south san francisco calif company exploring the biology of aging and the idea of targeting the isr to treat disease has been picked up by many other pharmaceutical companies walter says one might think that interfering with the isr a critical cellular safety mechanism would be sure to have serious side effects but so far in all their studies the researchers have observed none this is likely due to two factors walter says first it takes just a few doses of isrib to reset unhealthy chronic isr activation back to a healthier state after which it can still respond normally to problems in individual cells second isrib has virtually no effect when applied to cells actively employing the isr in its most powerful form against an aggressive viral infection for example naturally both of these factors make the molecule much less likely to have negative side effects and more attractive as a potential therapeutic it almost seems too good to be true but with isrib we seem to have hit a sweet spot for manipulating the isr with an ideal therapeutic window walter said authors other authors on the study were amber nolan elma s frias morgane boone katherine grue maria serena paladini and edward elizarraras of ucsf and gonzalo ureta luz

vandalized cherry blossom trees in s f japantown receive in crowdfunding spectacular that s the word paul osaki uses to describe mature cherry blossom trees in full flower they light up the sky so when a vandal destroyed two of the three cherry blossom trees outside the japanese cultural and community center of northern california methodically returning over three nights to snap every single branch it felt personal to the center s executive director first osaki was angry then the more he thought about the violence of the act and the destruction of a beautiful living symbol of san francisco s japantown he felt sad and disturbed i considered it kind of an assault or an attack on our cultural heritage osaki said adding that the trees were significant not just to the center but to the japanese culture cherry blossoms are synonymous with the japanese culture now they also represent solidarity news outlets including the chronicle picked up the story and a facebook note posted by the center about the vandalism received a flood of support when the nonprofit started a gofundme campaign last week that promised the cherry blossom trees will bloom again donations poured in over the first four days the crowdfunding effort received close to in contributions dwarfing its goal other donors have reached out separately offering to replace the trees including one gift before the campaign went online more than people have contributed some from far beyond the borders of japantown and san francisco these are people who don t know who we are they don t know the organization they probably have never come by osaki said they just saw this story and felt compelled to want to help we re just overwhelmed with the support gabrielle lurie the chronicle there are other cherry blossom trees throughout japantown a third tree in front of the cultural center and others along post street and in peace plaza but the two targeted were special they were planted to commemorate a visit to the center by the emperor and empress of japan in only the second time the monarchy had visited the united states they were also the first cherry blossom trees to be planted in japantown after the san francisco redevelopment agency tore through the neighborhood in the late s and s when i was growing up most of japantown was dirt lots like whole blocks with chain link fences around it osaki said redevelopment also took out whatever plants or trees were planted by the first generation of japanese it took months of planning and construction to get the pair of cherry blossom trees planted outside the center where osaki said they fit in with the building s fa ade and had grown to or feet tall over plus years a third tree in front of the center was similarly damaged two years ago the community response to the trees destruction has been a bright spot during a tough year in march the japanese cultural and community center shut down with the rest of the city and it has yet to reopen its income from activities and events has vanished as the pandemic continues throughout the neighborhood small businesses are struggling to stay afloat it s been incredibly difficult most of japantown s restaurants and stores rely an awful lot on tourism dollars osaki said for the last months tourists have been largely absent paul chinn the chronicle the cultural center has been using grant money to help small businesses but it s nothing compared to what they need osaki said he knew of several that had already closed and others that are teetering on the edge a lot are in jeopardy because of the rent they owe he said losing even a portion of the mom and pop ramen spots and gift shops that draw bay area residents and out of town visitors to japantown could have a reverberating effect on the historic area we re a small community osaki said even if you lose or businesses it s going to have a huge impact on japantown over the summer the center created a program called picnic in the plaza with tables and canopies and socially distanced seating for an effort to revitalize the dining scene and draw customers back to the neighborhood open on saturdays and sundays the area drew people before shutting down in november osaki said it brought life back to japantown you started to see people come by now he s looking to the cherry blossom trees as a symbol of hope for the future although osaki doesn t yet know how much it will cost to tear up the sidewalk and remove the damaged trunks using the money from the gofundme campaign and other contributions he hopes to have new trees planted by spring so they can bloom along with the rest of the neighborhood s cherry blossoms in addition to replacing the pair that was vandalized osaki would like to add a fourth tree outside the cultural center along with some kind of decorative barrier to protect the trees from future damage having that finished all the trees up and some kind of design that creatively brings it all together would really help commemorate this outpouring of support that we ve gotten from all over the place osaki said that s something we want to always remember that will be part of the story of the

youtube shuts down music companies use of manual copyright claims to steal creator revenue techcrunch youtube is making a change to its copyright enforcement policies around music used in videos which may result in an increased number of blocked videos in the shorter term but overall a healthier ecosystem in the long term going forward copyright owners will no longer be able to monetize creator videos with very short or unintentional uses of music via youtube s manual claiming tool instead they can choose to prevent the other party from monetizing the video or they can block the content however youtube expects that by removing the option to monetize these sorts of videos themselves some copyright holders will instead just leave them alone one concerning trend we ve seen is aggressive manual claiming of very short music clips used in monetized videos these claims can feel particularly unfair as they transfer all revenue from the creator to the claimant regardless of the amount of music claimed explained youtube in a blog post to be clear the changes only involve youtube s manual claiming tool which is not how the majority of copyright violations are handled today instead the majority of claims are created through youtube s content id match system this system scans videos uploaded to youtube against a database of files submitted to the site by copyright owners then when a match is found the copyright holder owner can choose to block the video or monetize it themselves and track the video s viewership stats the manual claiming tool on the other hand is only offered to partners who understand how content id works it allows them to search through publicly available youtube videos to look for those containing their content and apply a claim when a match is found the problem with the manual claiming policy is that it was impacting creator content even when the use of the claimed music in videos was very short even a second long or unintentional for example a creator who was vlogging may have walked past a store that was playing the copyrighted song but then could lose the revenue from their video as a result in april youtube said it was looking to address this problem and just ahead of this year s vidcon youtube announced several well received changes to the manual claiming policy it began to require that copyright owners specify the timestamp in the video where the claim occurs a change that youtube hoped would create additional friction and cut down on abuse creators were also given tools of their own that let them easily remove the clip or replace the infringing content with free to use tracks these newly announced changes go even further as they remove the ability for the copyright owner to monetize the infringing video at all copyright holders can now only prevent the creators themselves from monetizing the video or they can block the content however given the new creator tools for handling infringing content it s likely that creators in those situations would just address the problem content in order to keep their video online as always the best way to avoid these issues is to not use unlicensed content in your videos even when it s unintentional music playing in the background noted youtube it also urged creators to utilize its resources like the youtube audio library and to read up on youtube s dispute process policies before uploading content that the creator believes is a copyright exception due to fair use youtube says the changes will apply to all new manual claims starting in mid september once enforcement begins copyright owners who repeatedly fail to adhere to the policies will lose access to the manual claiming tool the response from the creator community not surprisingly has been positive as creators thanked youtube for finally listening to them and responding to their concerns over this sort of copyright claim abuse,pos

soviet submarine officer who averted nuclear war honoured with prize a senior officer of a soviet submarine who averted the outbreak of nuclear conflict during the cold war is to be honoured with a new prize years to the day after his heroic actions averted global catastrophe on october vasili alexandrovich arkhipov was on board the soviet submarine b near cuba when the us forces began dropping non lethal depth charges while the action was designed to encourage the soviet submarines to surface the crew of b had been incommunicado and so were unaware of the intention they thought they were witnessing the beginning of a third world war trapped in the sweltering submarine the air conditioning was no longer working the crew feared death but unknown to the us forces they had a special weapon in their arsenal a ten kilotonne nuclear torpedo what s more the officers had permission to launch it without waiting for approval from moscow two of the vessel s senior officers including the captain valentin savitsky wanted to launch the missile according to a report from the us national security archive savitsky exclaimed we re gonna blast them now we will die but we will sink them all we will not become the shame of the fleet but there was an important caveat all three senior officers on board had to agree to deploy the weapon as a result the situation in the control room played out very differently arkhipov refused to sanction the launch of the weapon and calmed the captain down the torpedo was never fired had it been launched the fate of the world would have been very different the attack would probably have started a nuclear war which would have caused global devastation with unimaginable numbers of civilian deaths the lesson from this is that a guy called vasili arkhipov saved the world thomas blanton director of the national security archive at george washington university told the boston globe in following a conference in which the details of the situation were explored now years after he averted nuclear war and years after his death arkhipov is to be honoured with his family the first recipients of a new award the prize dubbed the future of life award is the brainchild of the future of life insitute a us based organisation whose goal is to tackle threats to humanity and whose advisory board includes such luminaries as elon musk the astronomer royal prof martin rees and actor morgan freeman the future of life award is a prize awarded for a heroic act that has greatly benefited humankind done despite personal risk and without being rewarded at the time said max tegmark professor of physics at mit and leader of the future of life institute speaking to tegmark arkhipov s daughter elena andriukova said the family were grateful for the prize and its recognition of arkhipov s actions he always thought that he did what he had to do and never considered his actions as heroism he acted like a man who knew what kind of disasters can come from radiation she said he did his part for the future so that everyone can live on our planet the prize will be presented to arkhipov s grandson sergei and andriukova at the institute of engineering and technology on friday evening beatrice fihn executive director of the nobel peace prize winning organisation the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons said arkhipov s actions were a reminder of how the world had teetered on the brink of disaster arkhipov s story shows how close to nuclear catastrophe we have been in the past she said the timing of the award fihn added is apt as the risk of nuclear war is on the rise right now all states must urgently join the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons to prevent such catastrophe dr jonathan colman an expert on the cuban missile crisis at the university of central lancashire agreed that the award was fitting while accounts differ about what went on on board the b it is clear that arkhipov and the crew operated under conditions of extreme tension and physical hardship once the nuclear threshold had been crossed it is hard to imagine that the genie could have been put back into the bottle he said president kennedy had been very worried about the possibility of a clash between american warships and soviet submarines in the caribbean and it is absolutely clear that his fears were justified colman added noting that certain decisions at the operational level were out of his control ultimately it was luck as much as management that ensured that the missile crisis ended without the most dreadful consequences,pos

he has talked more than people off the ledge of the golden gate bridge kevin briggs has been called the guardian of the golden gate bridge he got the nickname while working as a california highway patrol officer for more than years briggs spent most of that time positioned on the golden gate bridge but the job turned out to be a lot more than he originally thought he was signing up for when briggs started out in he was trained to handle traffic incidents but had never received training on how to deal with people contemplating suicide he didn t know at the time how pervasive the issue of suicide on the bridge was there were four to six cases of suicidal folks on the bridge each and every month and i had no idea about this and i grew up in marin county which connects to san francisco via that golden gate bridge i had no training to handle these types of situations briggs says in his first encounter with a suicidal person he did about everything wrong that you could in the back of my mind i was thinking am i responsible if she does jump what happens here i had no training in this this is a really bad scene i was afraid i didn t know how to handle that situation briggs says he learned a lot from the encounters that followed i think my approach right from the start was wrong just to walk up right to those folks and start talking with them now what i do is i stand back and i ll just introduce myself i ll say hi i m kevin or i m kevin with the highway patrol is it okay is it alright if i come up and speak with you for a bit i want to get their permission and empower them since then kevin has talked to more than people standing on the edge of the bridge one of those people is kevin berthia he was very very very angry says briggs and he wanted nothing to do with me and he kept yelling at me stay back stay back if you come one step further i m jumping and he was very serious about this in my mind if i took one step further then he was gone the two spoke for more than minutes about the problems berthia was facing in his life briggs says he only spoke for about four or five minutes during the entire conversation eventually berthia decided to come back over and briggs helped him over the edge and congratulated him i asked him what happened here what was the turning point in this what did i do that helped this situation and what did i do that wasn t so good that hurt this situation and all he told me was you listened you let me speak and you listened and that s all he was looking for and that s all that many many people are looking for is someone to listen briggs says he thinks people contemplating suicide don t want to hear things like you ll get over it and it s going to get better what i believe personally they want to hear is yeah it is tough i try to explain to them wow that sounds really tough and normalize their situation that s a real big one is to try to normalize their situation you know wow what you re going through is a whole lot of stuff and that d be tough on anybody i think anyone going through all that might be thinking about suicide it takes a lot of courage to be over that rail it takes a lot of courage but it also takes a lot of courage to come back and face the reality that is with them right now but there is a brighter side to this and it can happen and it might take a long time and a lot of work but life is beautiful and you know it is worth living briggs says that although he can t fix any of the issues that people are dealing with it is important to listen and to try to understand what they are going through briggs retired from the california highway patrol in and he now works in suicide prevention this story originally aired on february it appears in the out in the open episode last words,pos

know where to go and are homeless he said i need to rescue these people who have been rendered homeless otherwise they will die commit suicide or get depressed prince manvendra is not talking in vague nebulous terms and actually has a solution in mind the royal is going so far as to transform his acre pink palace into a centre for vulnerable lgbt people the centre aims to deliver clinical services financial support and skills training for young lgbt people so they are able to become financially independent from their families he will run the centre with his community based organisation the lakshya trust which he started to support gay men and educate people about the prevention of hiv aids there are two aims one is social empowerment and the other is economic empowerment he explains the idea is to teach people how to become self reliant so they can earn their own living based on their skills and talents there is a lot of discrimination which the community faces so we want people to feel confident the royal who says he has been thinking about the idea for years also plans to use the centre to offer free safe sex seminars to young lgbt people across india and run workshops with parents who have accepted their children s sexuality he is constructing more buildings to house visitors to the centre who will be able to stay in shared accommodation the aptness of the palace being pink is not lost on prince manvendra our city is called the pink city of gujarat and most of the buildings are painted pink he explains it has been pink for almost years now and i always say maybe one of my ancestors painted it pink because they knew one of their relatives would like it he says the palace was visited by many hollywood stars back in the day and that ian fleming who wrote the james bond series of spy novels visited the palace as he was a friend of his great grandfather s but the prince is not getting the centre up and running on his own and has procured the support of kanwar amarjit singh a year old indian royal who is also an lgbt activist prince manvendra is so appreciative of mr singh s decision to help with funding he has named the centre after him it will be called hanumanteshwar amar mr singh who divides his time between india and london describes the prince as his mentor and explains their ancestors were great friends mr singh who runs a feminist art gallery near kings cross in london called amar gallery currently showing guerrilla girls artwork was driven out of india at the age of just after he spoke out about supporting gay rights though he himself is heterosexual the activist who is the main funder and support of prince manvendra s lgbt centre runs a grassroots network of activists in india that confronts the oppression of the lgbt community and women through education we work on advocacy for lgbt and women s rights mr singh says it makes me so angry the police in some townships are beating gay men and people for handing out condoms and girls as young as four being forced into prostitution we connected a decade ago and he has been a champion for lgbt rights since i have known him i consider him as an ally prince manvendra chips in kanwar amarjit singh and prince manvendra from left to right over in india prince manvendra also emphasises the importance of education and uses his platform to speak to university students about lgbt issues in fact the royal has had something of a turnaround since coming out and being shunned by society after coming out he has not only been accepted by his family but has been on the oprah winfrey show three times and even appeared on keeping up with the kardashians oprah s interview was a big turning point in my life he reflects the whole of society had turned against me but the moment i got invited on things changed she was extremely nice to me said she had interviewed many people in the last years but i was one of the most honest people she had ever met despite the progress prince manvendra has made and continues to make in india it is worth remembering that indian law continues to criminalise sexual acts between members of the same sex and homophobia remains deeply culturally ingrained nevertheless the supreme court of india has ordered a review of the legislation later this year in prince manvendra s view the problem is rooted in indian society s attitude to sex as a whole it is a taboo to even speak about sex and there is no sex education in schools he says ironically the prince who campaigns for the reform of india s anti lgbt laws says homosexual behaviour is far more accepted than heterosexual behaviour in the country men are affectionate with each other but heterosexual behaviour is not accepted he explains our country is a paradox in that way it is very easy to get a room for same sex at a hotel but if a male and female want a room you have to prove the relationship there are so many people in the closet living a double life you re supposed to live the way society wants you to live,pos
forest powered biofuel flight heads to washington d c seattle washington state based alaska airlines today made history flying the first commercial flight using the world s first renewable alternative jet fuel made from forest residuals the limbs and branches that remain after the harvesting of managed forests the alternative jet fuel was produced through the efforts of the washington state university led northwest advanced renewables alliance nara the demonstration flight departed seattle tacoma international airport this morning for reagan national airport in washington d c the flight was fueled with a percent blend of sustainable aviation biofuel which is chemically indistinguishable from regular jet a fuel the flight the first commercial passenger flight of its kind continues to advance viable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels for aviation reducing carbon footprint this latest milestone in alaska s efforts to promote sustainable biofuels is especially exciting since it is uniquely sourced from the forest residuals in the pacific northwest said joe sprague alaska airlines senior vice president of communications and external relations nara s accomplishments and the investment of the u s department of agriculture provide another key in helping alaska airlines and the aviation industry reduce its carbon footprint and dependency on fossil fuels while the gallons of biofuel used on the flight has a minimal impact to alaska airlines overall greenhouse gas emissions if the airline were able to replace percent of its entire fuel supply at sea tac airport it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about metric tons of co this is equivalent to taking approximately passenger vehicles off the road for one year nara is a five year project that launched in and is comprised of member organizations from industry academia and government laboratories today s flight represents its efforts to develop alternative jet fuel derived from post harvest forestry material that is often burned after timber harvest the forest residual feedstock used to power alaska airlines flight was sourced from tribal lands and private forestry operations in the pacific northwest in addition to producing gallons of biofuel used for the flight other key tasks of the project included evaluating the economic environmental and societal benefits and impacts associated with harvesting unused forest residuals for biofuel production empowering regional rural economies the nara initiative was made possible by a million grant from the u s department of agriculture national institute of food and agriculture nifa to support research on biofuels and biochemicals foster regional supply chain coalitions empower rural economic development and educate the public on the benefits of bioenergy today is a tribute to all of our nara partners and especially to nifa who supported our mission to facilitate the revolutionary development of biojet and bioproduct industries in the pacific northwest using forest residuals that would otherwise become waste products said ralph cavalieri nara executive director we are proud of every one of the partners and stakeholders from forest managers to gevo and alaska airlines who have laid the foundations for a renewable fuel economy that will keep skies clear and healthy with the potential to bolster economically challenged timber based rural communities in our region gevo inc a nara partner successfully adapted its patented technologies to convert cellulosic sugars derived from wood waste into renewable isobutanol which was then converted into gevo s alcohol to jet atj fuel believed to be the world s first alternative jet fuel produced from wood the fuel meets international astm american society for testing and materials standards allowing it to be used safely for today s commercial flight wsu among many partners stakeholders this first of its kind flight demonstrates gevo s commitment and ability to convert a wide range of sugar feedstocks into drop in renewable fuels said pat gruber gevo s chief executive officer we are pleased that we had the opportunity to prove through the nara project that cellulosic sugars from wood can be used to successfully make commercial jet fuel we congratulate our fellow nara partners and thank the usda nifa for its unwavering support in the pursuit of renewable jet fuel i also thank alaska airlines which continues to be a great partner several elected officials joined the passengers on the alaska airlines boeing jet bound for the nation s capital including u s rep suzan delbene wa u s rep dave reichert wa and u s rep denny heck wa i am proud to see the world s first biojet fuel made from forest residuals being flown on an alaska airlines airplane said u s sen patty murray the pacific northwest continues to be on the cutting edge of new technology that will make airplanes better safer and more efficient and i m thrilled that so many stakeholders came together and that washington state university has led this important effort expanding global competitiveness today s flight comes after years of investments to help the aviation biofuels industry take off said u s sen maria cantwell by creating these sustainable biofuels we will revitalize our rural agricultural communities foster economic growth reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cut our dependence on foreign oil while growing our competitiveness in global markets today s flight demonstrates that washington state s innovation economy is once again at the forefront of collaborative transformative research by using material that would otherwise be discarded to create a new biofuel said delbene here in the pacific northwest we know that the natural environment that surrounds us is what makes living here so

the largest ever tropical reforestation is planting million trees advertisement advertisement there are more habitable planets in our galaxy than humans living on planet earth but the nearest one is about trillion miles away which means that for now and for the foreseeable future earth is the only life supporting rock hurtling through infinite space we ll ever know it s really not the best idea to let it burn up and key to keeping it cool are the massive rainforests of the amazon sadly we ve had a hard time not cutting them down advertisement advertisement a new project should help prevent or at least slow down that hot future if all goes to plan over the next six years a project led by conservation international will become the largest tropical reforestation project in history seventy three million trees will sprout up across what s known as the arc of deforestation in the brazilian states of amazonas acre par rond nia and throughout the xingu watershed the short term plan is to restore acres the area of soccer fields that have been cleared for pastureland to their former forested glory if the world is to hit the c or c degrees of warming target that we all agreed to in paris then protecting tropical forests in particular has to be a big part of that m sanjayan ceo of conservation international tells fast company it s not just the trees that matter but what kind of trees if you re really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of atmosphere then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most he s right simply stopping deforestation could allow existing forests to absorb up to of our annual carbon emissions replenishing degraded areas could do significantly more for the planet advertisement this is not a stunt sanjayan says it is a carefully controlled experiment to literally figure out how to do tropical restoration at scale so that people can replicate it and we can drive the costs down dramatically over the past years about of the amazon has been cut down or destroyed and scientists worry that another of the rainforest will be lost in the next couple of decades so instead of following precedent and planting saplings which are labor and resource intensive to manage and depending on the selected species may not be best suited for the territory resulting in less than ideal survival rates the organizing coalition is trying something different developed in brazil only a few years ago the new planting technique is called muvuca in portuguese it means a lot of people in a very small place says rodrigo medeiros conservation international s vice president of the brazil program and the lead on the ground advertisement the muvuca strategy demands that seeds from more than native forest species are spread over every square meter of burnt and mismanaged land the seeds are purchased from the xingu seed network which since has acted as a native seed supply for more than organizations thanks a collection of more than seed collectors many of whom are indigenous women and local youths of course even in nitrogen and phosphorus rich soil only some of these seeds will survive but that bit of natural selection is key to the muvuca magic several seeds germinate compete between themselves for nutrients and sunlight and the strongest ultimately become big trees according to a study by the food and agriculture organization and bioversity international more than of native tree species planted with this strategy germinate and they re especially resilient able to survive drought conditions for up to six months without irrigation with plant by plant reforestation techniques you get a typical density of about plants per hectare says medeiros with muvuca the initial outcome is species per hectare and after years you can reach trees per hectare it s much more diverse much more dense and less expensive than traditional techniques advertisement working alongside conservation international are the brazilian ministry of environment the global environment facility gef the world bank the brazilian biodiversity fund funbio and rock in rio s environmental arm amazonia live while this coalition provides the high level leadership it s actually indigenous communities and small family farmers who have ownership of this project in any given hectare as many as locals will be actively working together to reforest the land typically private farmland but also government owned protected zones and indigenous territories pay is issued evenly among participants and families can earn about per hectare reforested the finances are typically managed by a local ngo in the field with support from project sponsors already a couple million trees have been planted and it s a win win situation for all involved parties says medeiros the coalition gets labor at a fair price indigenous communities can maintain their livelihoods and get recognition as the rightful owners of rainforest land and farmers sign partnership agreements to fast track recovery on their own land with logistical support springs rivers and streams that were suffering from the lack of water are already beginning to show signs of recovery in the region says medeiros which has led to more productive soil and better yields for farmers too advertisement,pos

anyone in oklahoma can now get the covid vaccine thanks to several native tribes cnn any resident of oklahoma can now get the covid vaccine but it s not because of the state s health department instead oklahomans have several native tribes to thank last week the chickasaw nation opened up covid vaccine appointments to all oklahoma residents regardless of whether they are citizens of the tribe other tribes headquartered in oklahoma have expanded vaccinations beyond tribal citizens too the osage choctaw and citizen potawatomi nations are offering vaccines to all members of the public while the cherokee nation has opened appointments to anyone residing within its county jurisdiction the state of oklahoma meanwhile is currently on phase of its vaccine distribution plan that criteria covers a wide swath of people including healthcare workers first responders residents and older those with medical conditions teachers and school staff students and older people in congregate settings public health staff government officials and essential workers still all residents won t be eligible under the state s plan until phase tribes want to reach herd immunity the tribal nations in oklahoma received allotments of the vaccine fromthe indian health service as those tribes demonstrated that they were able to get shots into arms quickly they received more and more doses allowing them to expand their efforts beyond their own populations dr john krueger chief medical officer for the chickasaw nation credits the tribe s robust infrastructure for its ability to offer vaccines to non native members of the community the chickasaw nation recently opened a new facility in the city of ada with drive thru lines dramatically increasing its capacity the tribe also has three other vaccination sites as well as a team that travels to people s homes krueger added now that those in the chickasaw nation s priority groups have been offered vaccines the tribe is able to move on to those outside the tribe we are a part of these communities and they are a part of us krueger said the faster we can get all of us back to essential protection the better it is for us and the better it is for everyone the chickasaw nation has administered more than vaccines to date according to krueger roughly chickasaw citizens live within the tribe s jurisdiction in south central oklahoma the choctaw nation also attributes their newfound capacity to the success they experienced in vaccinating early priority groups such as elders it s not necessarily an issue of supply outpacing demand says cpt clinton bullock director of pharmacy for the choctaw nation health care center rather the tribe is capitalizing on the resources offered by the indian health service to help protect the rest of the state there are of course non native members of the community that our tribal citizens come in contact with bullock said helping to develop this herd immunity not only benefits the tribal members but the community as a whole the choctaw nation has administered more than vaccines according to bullock some tribes have seen demand decline part of the reason some tribal nations have been able to open up vaccines to anyone who wants one is because of vaccine hesitancy dr ronald shaw ceo of the osage nation wahzhazhe health center said the tribe s health system initially followed centers for disease control and prevention guidelines in its vaccine distribution after about a month the criteria became somewhat of an obstacle so they quickly opened up vaccines to more age groups eventually they were offering shots to all non native people despite the broad invitation shaw says demand has remained low adding that people in rural parts of osage county have seemed reluctant to get the vaccines that hesitancy meant that we have more vaccine to give beyond just the native american patients in our area so that s translated to more vaccines for non indians shaw said krueger said that when the chickasaw nation has opened up vaccinations for a particular group there s been an initial surge in demand followed by an eventual drop off the tribe is continuing to combat vaccine hesitancy within those early priority groups krueger said but in the meantime they have the resources to vaccinate others around them and recognize that doing so will help protect the entire community we have plenty of capacity right now to not only take care of the community but also take care of those in the tribe s priority groups so anybody that that needs a vaccine can get one he said tribes have often outpaced states in distribution native people get their health care from a patchwork system of indian health service facilities tribally operated clinics and urban indian health centers and vaccination efforts have varied from tribe to tribe and state to state but as states and counties struggled with disorganized rollouts glitchy sign up forms and long lines many tribal nations and clinics were able to vaccinate their populations quickly the option to receive allotments from the indian health service or from their state gave tribal health clinics more independence in distribution and the autonomy to determine what groups should get priority helped tribes protect the most vulnerable members of their population existing robust health systems helped tribes reach their citizens more efficiently while tailored messaging helped to build trust in the vaccine,pos

one woman s race to defuse the genetic time bomb in her genes in sonia vallabh was handed a genetic report that contained a death sentence but it also held a map for how to escape her body she learned harbored a gene mutation a single wrong letter of dna in her prion gene that would eventually lead to a rare brain condition called fatal familial insomnia her mother had died of it the year before and the test had revealed vallabh had inherited the flaw too by now the decision by vallabh and her husband eric minikel to try to prevent her disease a prion love story the new yorker called it is well known after the diagnosis of the genetic time bomb they dropped out of their careers in law and engineering and became scientists dedicated to defusing it they expect to get phds next spring see sonia vallabh innovators under now after seven years they think they have found a treatment that can do it it s called an antisense drug a type of mirror image molecule that if it reaches the brain could greatly reduce the amount of the prion protein that could potentially forestall the mysterious chain reaction of misfolding proteins that characterize prion diseases less of the protein vallabh reasons and less chance she ll get sick two weeks ago on their blog vallabh announced she and minikel were working with a commercial partner the california biotech company ionis which specializes in antisense compounds for the first time i am optimistic about a specific therapeutic strategy she wrote it s plausible that antisense could treat the disease in our lifetime vallabh s race to prevent her own prion disease raises a question for the genetic age given a perfect dna blueprint of your inherited disease what s your chance of stopping it in your lifetime or that of someone you love there are reasons to think these types of medical long shots have become more likely to hit the mark that is because gene sequencing can cheaply reveal molecular flaws but also because a set of promising technologies antisense gene therapy and crispr gene editing are able to replace genes or silence them in effect fixing genetic problems at their source a close up of up brain tissue affected by prions misfolded protein that are toxic to neurons wikimedia commons what s more these treatments employ the genetic code they are actually made of dna or rna that means that they re fundamentally modular and programmable at least on paper it is now possible to take any genetic flaw and quickly sketch an antidote in reality drug development is notoriously complicated most drugs fail torn down by biological surprises and unexpected toxicity to the human body but vallabh says in the early confusing days of her quest she received critical advice from eric lander the biologist who leads the broad institute where she and minikel now study and work he told her to focus on the genetic error itself the blueprint of which was in her diagnosis you need to see what you have in your hand and stop looking she recalls him saying that meant not waiting to answer important scientific unknowns like what the prion protein does in the body or why when it misfolds it kills brain cells there are so many interesting questions about prion disease says vallabh who is and those questions will still be there when we are treating it prion diseases are profoundly strange because they re caused not by a virus but by an infectious protein they include scrapie in sheep kuru spread by cannibalism creutzfelt jakob disease and the human version of mad cow disease the key drug insight was that mice engineered to lack the prion protein gene never get sick even when scientists inject infectious prions into their brains the biological concept of a prion is a protein that changes it conformation and that can template further copies it s self templating that allows it to spread says kurt giles a researcher in the lab at the university of california san francisco where prions were first discovered that leads to the idea of reducing the protein the less of it there is then you will get less templating for genetic therapies though there s a further problem which is how to get them into the body so that they reach for instance billions of brain cells antisense technology conceived decades ago had its big breakthrough last year when a drug developed by ionis proved to be astoundingly effective in treating a childhood neurological disorder spinal muscular atrophy by then vallabh and minikel had been introduced to ionis and the company had agreed to provide them with antisense compounds targeted to the prion gene to test in mice holly kordasiewicz the head of neuroscience at ionis recalls the meeting we left the room saying we need to do everything that we can to help these people she says the company gave vallabh and minikel a to do list which they quickly worked through patient registry check animal studies check biomarker to show if a drug is working that research too is under way at a boston hospital studying prion protein levels in spinal fluid sonia and eric are doing this with no real funding just trying to make it happen says jeff carroll another patient scientist he s got the mutation for huntington s disease who introduced them to ionis one problem not as easily addressed is that prion disease is astoundingly rare quickly fatal and rarely diagnosed in advance that means there has been no great clamor for treatments maybe only people in the u s know they have a time bomb like vallabh she says and there s not a single drug currently in human testing early on ionis let the pair know the collaboration was strictly academic and not a commercial prospect but by blotting out the prion protein at its source an antisense treatment might help with a range of rare conditions linked to it fatal insomnia is vanishingly uncommon as are cases of mad cow disease but adding these ultra rare diseases together makes them as a group slightly less rare vallabh and minikel say they now have proof that ionis s antisense molecules partly protect mice from prion disease those animals given the drug live about percent longer kordasiewicz now terms the program a commercial project at ionis though it remains too small and early stage to appear on the company s pipeline chart of drugs under development what changed is the data is looking good enough that we think we can have a drug in five years she says vallabh hopes it can all go even faster the fatal insomnia could begin to afflict her tomorrow or in years there s no way to predict it she and minikel just had their first child the girl was conceived through ivf and vallabh says the lab employed a genetic test to assure them she wouldn t carry the mutation to save herself it s not going to be enough to have a drug she needs to get it before she ever falls ill yet doctors have little experience giving such a genetic drug over many years as a form of prevention figuring out how to carry off such a study is the next challenge for vallabh and her husband it appears they hope the us food and drug administration will permit a prevention trial in patients who carry the prion mutations since it can take decades for people to get sick or not such a study would instead rely on a biomarker such as whether antisense injections can reduce prion protein levels in the spinal fluid vallabh told me she would volunteer to take the drug the big picture she says is we are moving much more quickly than anyone could expect due to this beautifully clear genetic blueprint we were

lgbt workers are protected from workplace discrimination texas judge says in earth shattering new ruling austin for the first time in texas a federal judge said lgbt workers should be protected from employment discrimination based on their gender identity and sexual orientation judge lee rosenthal the chief judge in the houston based southern district court of texas said in a decision last week that federal employment law protecting workers from discrimination based on sex also applies to sexual orientation and gender identity nicole wittmer an engineer who alleged she wasn t hired by energy company phillips because she s transgender couldn t prove her claim rosenthal ruled but if she had proof the judge added wittmer would have had cause to sue under federal law rosenthal s ruling doesn t mean it s suddenly illegal in texas to discriminate against lgbt workers but it may be cited in the future by others who believe their sexual orientation or gender identity was a factor in workplace decisions wittmer s lawyer told the dallas morning news we re certainly disappointed that this particular ruling did not fall in her favor alfonso kennard jr said monday the silver lining here is it has helped to define the landscape for people who have been discriminated against in the workplace due to their transgender status this ruling is earth shattering in a good way a growing trend federal judges in several other states have already decided that lesbian gay bisexual and transgender workers are also covered under title vii the civil rights era law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace but there has never been such a decision by a federal court in texas louisiana or mississippi the states covered by the th u s circuit court of appeals texas state law also doesn t prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity which means it s still legal for texas employers to fire or fail to hire someone because they re lgbt rosenthal who was appointed in by president george h w bush said recent decisions in other jurisdictions helped shape her decision within the last year several circuits have expanded title vii protection to include discrimination based on transgender status and sexual orientation rosenthal wrote although the fifth circuit has not yet addressed the issue these very recent circuit cases are persuasive the court assumes that wittmer s status as a transgender woman places her under the protections of title vii harper jean tobin policy director at the national center for transgender equality characterized the decision as part of a growing consensus that title vii covers trans workers as well this ruling along with dozens of others shows that discrimination against transgender workers is illegal under federal law tobin said in a prepared statement this is the overwhelming approach of the courts across the country over the last decade dale carpenter a constitutional law and lgbt rights expert at southern methodist university said the ruling was the first of its kind in texas it goes beyond a case in which another federal judge in texas said gender nonconforming persons could not be discriminated against in the workplace he said because this one also recognizes transgender status as a protected trait it is significant carpenter said of rosenthal s decision agreeing with tobin he called it part of a growing trend around the country the decision could provide cover for other lgbt workers carpenter added who are not protected for employment discrimination under state law someone could sue and cite this case he said and if they win at the th circuit it would create a new precedent for the entire region just based on the sheer population of texas carpenter said if it becomes the rule in texas this would be the single biggest victory against employment discrimination that has yet to be enjoyed by the lgbt rights movement,pos
old navy target and warby parker are paying employees to vote and work at the polls on august civic alliance announced that more than of its member companies which include starbucks old navy target and microsoft will work to encourage employees and consumers to serve as poll workers the organization set a recruitment goal of poll workers the projected number of staffers necessary to keep precincts up and running smoothly the election is less than two months away and for months voting rights organizations have sounded the alarm bells about the possibility of a poll worker shortage poll workers are the community members who greet voters at their local precinct check their registration and direct them to voting booths according to pew s stateline these staffers presence could be the difference between a smooth election and long lines mass confusion and miscounted ballots anyone over can sign up to work during election day and be compensated for their time however a majority of these crucial workers are usually senior citizens who are likely to refrain from working at the polls out of concern for their health during a pandemic even prior to the coronavirus however nearly percent of states and jurisdictions have struggled to recruit a sufficient number of staff the responsibility of poll worker recruitment should theoretically fall on local and state policymakers but currently corporations are jumping in to fill this gap and partnering with bipartisan voter organizations like civic alliance and power to the polls to address the shortage old navy a subsidiary of gap inc announced on september that its employees would receive a day s worth of pay if they signed up to work at the polls target warby parker and dc based coffee chain compass coffee will also give workers paid time off to serve as election workers on top of these efforts high profile companies like starbucks twitter paypal walmart and uber have said they plan to give workers time off to vote some are offering workers as little as three hours of paid leave while others are giving employees election day off poll workers are needed now more than ever we re proud to offer paid time off to our team volunteering on election day and we want you to join us by volunteering you are making a real and meaningful difference in our democracy check out powerthepolls for more info pic twitter com hsjctmnvow compass coffee compasscoffeedc september heather marshall a caf manager at compass told vox that in previous years she had voted via absentee ballot and that the thought of serving as a poll worker hadn t really crossed her mind when she was a college student given the pandemic i wasn t sure what this year would look like in terms of in person voting she wrote via email so when compass employees were approached with the idea to be poll workers i knew it was something for which i needed to volunteer my time i want to be any part of the effort to ensure a free fair and covid safe election this push from employers like compass to staff up the polls is the latest move by corporate america to encourage civic participation as companies take on a pro democracy and pro voter stance without fear of alienating the political views of any given customer or employee in bloomberg reported that a record percent of us firms committed to giving workers paid time off to vote in the midterm elections this was an increase of percentage points from the election according to the society for human resources management for the midterms the outdoor apparel company patagonia launched a campaign called time to vote and enlisted companies that represent over million workers in addition to staffing up election sites this year companies are also donating personal protective equipment disseminating information about how to vote and even offering up building space the director of civic alliance told the wall street journal american consumers and workers increasingly expect corporations to take stances or at the very least engage on political and social issues a case study by the harvard kennedy school found that consumers are more likely to buy from companies that have encouraged people to participate in the democratic process the companies analyzed in the study which included snapchat spotify patagonia target and gap had a range of voter engagement programs from internal efforts directed at employees to public campaigns that sought to reach millions of people what s interesting is that more and more companies are making their voting policies public which shifts the burden of knowledge away from the individual said philip chen an assistant professor of political science at beloit college before this if you didn t have the civic knowledge or engagement to figure out that you are legally allowed to have three unpaid or paid hours to go vote you probably weren t going to vote employee voting policies though fluctuate depending on the company patagonia will shut down all of its operations on election day as it did in and while walmart will grant its employees three hours off if the hours of their shift prevent them from voting in some cases workers will have to give their supervisor a day s notice about their need to leave to vote since managers are creating voting plans to ensure that shifts remain staffed on election day what s interesting is that more and more companies are making their voting policies public which shifts the burden of knowledge away from the individual these corporate driven voter initiatives are a positive development considering how companies decades ago remained mum on the issue however the growing involvement of employers and the reliance on companies to staff polls and increase turnout is emblematic of the us being an outlier in established democracies chen said the us s voter turnout rate is behind that of other established democracies in the presidential election the census bureau reported that only percent of the voting age population cast a ballot that s low compared to countries like belgium percent turnout and sweden percent america ranks th out of developed democracies when it comes to voter participation voting is not compulsory in the united states nor is voter registration automatic or simple plus there isn t a federal holiday for citizens to take time off from work to vote thanks to a federal law passed by congress in the th century election day always falls on a tuesday in november this is unlike what other democracies have countries like austria australia luxembourg and singapore mandate attendance at the polls while others like france israel and south korea vote on weekends or have instituted federal holidays to encourage turnout in the us however each state has established its own voting laws the short answer is these laws are entirely dependent on the state chen told vox some states require paid time off while others have universal vote by mail some have no requirements and simply encourage employers to allow their workers to vote most states though have something in the middle where workers have to meet a set of criteria to take off time to vote in states election day is a paid holiday for state employees although workers might only get a few hours of leave meanwhile in places like oregon and washington residents have ballots mailed out to them so voting is a task primarily completed at home with more companies actively encouraging their employees to vote and serve as poll workers that could likely contribute to an improvement in turnout yet it s difficult to predict how the coronavirus pandemic and the postal service slowdown will affect the election and voter participation during the primaries earlier this year the washington post reported that some half a million mail in ballots were rejected as a result of late delivery or voter error plus as recode s adam clark estes reported mail service has recently been disrupted nationwide due to covid and a series of cost cutting policies instituted by its new postmaster general louis dejoy voting rights advocates and politicians are encouraging citizens to make a plan and vote early and tech companies like snapchat and facebook are rolling out voter checklist features for users to easily register companies are trying to reduce institutional barriers to voting but political scientists aren t exactly certain how having a federal voting holiday or automatic registration would increase turnout chen added these barriers absolutely have an effect but it s hard to figure out the exact effect what these corporations are looking to do is trying to approximate the system we see in other established democracies he said they re trying to replicate what we see with paid election holidays which certainly helps with informing people and it also looks good from a corporate standpoint,pos
china s vow to shut down its ivory trade by the end of is a game changer for elephants an assistant arranges a carved ivory tusk in the window of a hong kong store in october simon denyer the washington post china promised friday to halt its domestic ivory trade completely by the end of a decision greeted by environmentalists as offering real hope for an end to a poaching crisis that is wiping out tens of thousands of elephants across africa china s announcement is a game changer for elephant conservation carter roberts president of the world wildlife fund said in a statement the large scale trade of ivory now faces its twilight years and the future is brighter for wild elephants china said it would begin phasing out the ivory trade in march and cease processing and trading completely by dec the natural resources defense council a new york based environmental advocacy group said the news may be the biggest sign of hope for elephants since the current poaching crisis began while grace ge gabriel asia director at the international fund for animal welfare said she was overwhelmed with joy this is great news that will shut down the world s largest market for elephant ivory said aili kang asia director at the wildlife conservation society ivory traffickers have just lost one of their biggest markets customs officers seize ivory tusks rhino horn and leopard skins at the hong kong customs headquarters in alex hofford it is a huge step for a country that had previously argued that ivory carving was part of its cultural heritage and where intricately carved ivory items had become popular gifts to grease the wheels of government and business the government was moved not just by international pressure but also by changing attitudes among ordinary chinese celebrities such as former nba star yao ming have led campaigns to stop the buying of ivory and simply to educate people that elephants had to die for the ivory to be taken there was also a realization that china s key role in the illicit ivory trade was damaging its image in africa after the market is shuttered the chinese ministry of culture will help ivory sector employees find other jobs for example encouraging master carvers to work in museums to help repair and maintain significant ivory works of art the statement said the government also pledged to ramp up law enforcement and educate the public to reject ivory peter knights chief executive of wildaid a san francisco based group at the forefront of efforts to change chinese attitudes toward the ivory trade called it the best possible news for africa s elephants and congratulated president xi jinping for his leadership on the issue although poaching may have peaked a few years ago some african elephants continue to be killed for their tusks every year experts say largely to meet demand from asia and particularly china for ivory africa s elephant population has dwindled from about million years ago to between and

walks through the bush at the southern african wildlife college denis farrell ap the global trade thought to be worth around billion annually is run by international criminal syndicates sometimes with help from african rebel groups but even if a ban is enforced in china some experts warn that the trade could shift across the border into neighboring laos vietnam and burma where large markets flourish selling endangered wildlife products to chinese consumers there is also a danger of traders passing off elephant ivory as legal mammoth ivory still a clear signal from the chinese government is seen as going a long way toward making ivory as unfashionable here as it is in the west china retains a small stock of legal ivory purchased in when international trade in it was allowed the state has been gradually supplying that ivory to carving workshops and selling it domestically but this legal business experts say has provided cover for a vast underground trade network the announcement follows a pledge by xi and president obama in september to end the domestic trade in ivory in their respective countries hong kong another major hub for ivory smuggling announced last week that it would raise maximum penalties for wildlife crime to years and phase out its own trade in ivory by the end of although pressure may now mount for it to move more quickly in january china signaled how official attitudes were changing by staging a ceremony to crush six tons of tusks and carved ivory ornaments that had been seized in anti trafficking operations the united states has largely closed down its own ivory market by banning trade at the federal level and in several states but experts said it still needs to do more in terms of enforcement the last bastion of the trade is now japan said

republic of congo names new national park home to gorillas elephants the new ogoou leketi national park is the republic of congo s fifth national park it borders bat k plateau national park in neighboring gabon and together the two parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than square kilometers square miles the official designation of ogoou leketi national park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down all of the rights holding communities that live close to the ogoou leketi national park were involved in the process of creating the protected area according to the wildlife conservation society s congo program the republic of congo has officially created its fifth national park lending protection to great apes forest elephants and other threatened wildlife the new ogoou leketi national park spans square kilometers square miles and borders bat k plateau national park in neighboring gabon together the two national parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than square kilometers square miles ogoou leketi is also part of the bat k plateau landscape a unique patchwork of large rolling savannas on sandy hills interrupted by long strips of dense forests and turquoise blue river valleys this savanna forest complex is home to several threatened species some found nowhere else in congo according to a press release from the wildlife conservation society s congo program which has been surveying the area with the country s ministry of forestry economy since in the iucn identified the region in which the park sits today as a priority conservation site for the protection of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla gorilla gorilla gorilla and the endangered central chimpanzee pan troglodytes troglodytes said mark gately country director for wcs congo the forest sector of the new park is also home to several other species such as the african forest elephant loxodonta cyclotis forest buffalo syncerus caffer nanus red river hog potamochoerus porcus and several species of monkey including the iconic mandrill mandrillus sphinx the savanna part of the national park too hosts a wide range of wildlife the park has at least six species of rare savanna plants that are specialists of the kalahari sands the substrate that forms the bat k plateau and other savanna specialists like the bush duiker sylvicapra grimmia side striped jackal canis adustus and several species of birds the national park area was in fact identified by birdlife international as a site of high importance for bird conservation in the official designation of ogoou leketi national park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down logging activity had expanded into the proposed protected area since gately said with loggers searching mainly for okoum trees aucoumea klaineana for use in plywood all three logging companies which are still active around the periphery of the park completed logging within parts of the concessions overlapping the park in december with the support of the congolese minister of forestry economy mrs rosalie matondo the creation of the park has eliminated logging activity within the protected area boundaries securing the closed canopy forest habitat that covers roughly a third of the park gately said the roads and bridges that the logging companies built into the proposed park area have however facilitated commercial bushmeat hunting such hunting is currently the biggest threat to the area s wildlife and this trade links to cities like pointe noire and brazzaville but also across the border towards gabon gately said great ape numbers have declined significantly in the area since and elephants even if their population seems stable recently started changing their behaviour visiting forest clearings more at night than during the day behaviour that is generally observed in elephant populations that perceive threats from humans in their habitat gately added with the logging companies out the government and wcs congo are now working with local communities to draw up a management plan for the national park while no villages existed inside the area now designated as ogoou leketi national park there are five villages very close to the park boundary the residents of these villages have traditionally used the national park area for their needs and continue to depend on the forest for their sustenance all of the rights holding communities living near the national park were involved in the process of creating the protected area since the project was launched gately said the boundaries of the protected area were mapped to ensure the villages weren t incorporated into the national park the communities also helped identify and map areas of cultural and traditional importance to them the participatory mapping process led the government to highlight any cultural or natural resource use zones that overlap with critical high ecological value areas including bais swampy mineral rich meadows that will be integrated into the park under eco development zones gately said in these identified areas which will be integrated into the management plan of the park rights holding communities will be able to continue traditional and subsistence based gathering fishing or hunting the maps including the limit of the future park and the eco development zones were validated for each village in order to ensure full consent banner

austria is turning site of hitler s birth into a police station to repel neo nazis austria s interior minister wolfgang peschorn announced tuesday that the country will turn the birthplace of adolf hitler into a police station in the hopes of preventing it from becoming a neo nazi shrine the future use of the house by the police should send an unmistakable signal that the role of this building as a memorial to the nazis has been permanently revoked peschorn said in a statement neo nazis have reportedly long frequented the house in downtown braunau am inn turning it into a pilgrimage site of sorts the government has tried to step in and stop that from happening for quite a while but the building s owner had refused sell it even though the interior ministry had taken over the main lease in the owner also refused to renovate the building which meant it was difficult to rent to tenants who would turn it into an administrative educational or social services building as required by the government so it remained challenging to prevent hitler s admirers from flocking to it even as support for nazism dwindled but the government seized the building in and will now hold a redesign competition for architects that will begin this month as the building transitions into the hands of law enforcement the timing of the announcement is not insignificant as some far right parties have continued to make gains in europe read more at the new york times tim o donnell,pos

when a california city gave people a guaranteed income they worked more not less the city of stockton california embarked on a bold experiment two years ago it decided to distribute a month to people for months with no strings attached and no work requirements the people were randomly chosen from neighborhoods at or below the city s median household income and they were free to spend the money any way they liked meanwhile researchers studied what impact the cash had on their lives the results from the first year of the experiment which spanned from february to february are now in and they re extremely encouraging for its participants and for advocates who see unconditional cash transfers as an effective way to help people escape poverty the most eye popping finding is that the people who received the cash managed to secure full time jobs at more than twice the rate of people in a control group who did not receive cash within a year the proportion of cash recipients who had full time jobs jumped from percent to percent the control group saw only a percent jump over the same period the researchers wrote in their report that the money gave recipients the stability they needed to set goals take risks and find new jobs one man in his s had been eligible for a real estate license for over a year but hadn t gotten it because he just couldn t afford to take time off work thanks to the freedom offered by the extra per month he said his life was converted degrees because i have more time and net worth to study to achieve my goals sign up for the future perfect newsletter twice a week we ll send you a roundup of the best ideas and solutions for tackling the world s biggest challenges and how to get better at doing good sign up here critics of cash assistance programs often say that handing out free money will make people less inclined to find jobs but in the research done to date unconditional cash does not tend to disincentivize work in several programs from alaska and north carolina in the us to finland and spain in europe it has had no effect on employment either way in some cases it seems to embolden people with an entrepreneurial bent for instance in japan initial survey results have shown that recipients are times more interested in launching a new business employment aside there are clear benefits to unconditional cash programs the stockton experiment which was conducted as a randomized controlled trial and underwent an independent evaluation adds to the growing body of evidence from basic income experiments around the world which shows that getting unconditional cash tends to boost happiness health school attendance and trust in social institutions while reducing crime more benefits and some limitations of stockton s guaranteed income trial there were other benefits from the stockton program cash recipients reported being less anxious and depressed than the control group on average the recipients experienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in their mental health that the control group did not moving from likely having a mild mental health disorder to likely mental wellness over the year long intervention according to the researchers the cash also enabled recipients to help their family and friends for example one woman used the cash to help her siblings buy school clothes for their kids and to help her daughter in law pay for car insurance another bought diapers for her grandchildren this isn t the first time we ve seen cash programs have positive ripple effects on the broader community in kenya cash transfers have stimulated the economy and benefited not only the recipients themselves but also people in nearby villages it s worth noting a wrinkle in the stockton trial each participant was given per month on a debit card so that researchers would be able to see how they were using the money however percent of it was either withdrawn as cash or transferred to an existing bank account so researchers had to rely on participants to tell them where the money went of the money tracked on the debit cards recipients spent most on necessities like food percent home goods and clothes percent utilities percent and car costs percent they spent less than percent on alcohol or cigarettes though these numbers can t capture the full picture they offer a counter to harmful stereotypes and faulty assumptions that people who become poor get that way because they re bad at rational decision making and self control and that they ll blow free money on frivolous things or addictive substances the evidence does not support these beliefs the stockton experiment was a small study with only cash recipients so the findings should be seen as offering supporting evidence on the effectiveness of cash programs rather than as definitive standalone proof nevertheless the results of this philanthropically funded program officially known as the stockton economic empowerment demonstration seed which received a million grant from the economic security project help underscore that poverty is a lack of cash not character and usefully add to the body of evidence that free money doesn t disincentivize employment it can actually boost it the implications for policy during the pandemic and beyond the message that free money can actually improve job prospects comes at a critical moment as the biden administration tries to push through a pandemic aid package that would include direct checks to millions of americans the pandemic has made the idea of direct payments more popular with the covid crisis generating so much financial loss and uncertainty advocates have argued that citizens desperately need some sort of income floor and against this backdrop seed has spawned something much bigger mayors for a guaranteed income a coalition of mayors who are pushing for the us to implement a federal guaranteed income both seed and the mayoral coalition are the brainchild of michael tubbs the former mayor of stockton for years now tubbs has promoted the idea that a guaranteed income could transform life for stockton residents but he s also made clear this experiment is about a lot more than just his city stockton is a proxy for america its diversity its people he said it s a place that s emerging and has big bold ideas guaranteed income is a big bold idea that could improve life for millions of americans if implemented more widely that said it s not a cure all for the systemic obstacles that keep people from a healthy stable life as the seed researchers wrote in their report guaranteed income should not be considered as a singular approach for household stability but rather as one policy option to be implemented alongside others to shore up market failures other policy options include increasing the supply of affordable housing and raising the minimum wage for now only the first year s worth of data from the stockton experiment is available we have to wait until for the full results but the first year findings signal that guaranteed income programs combined with better public policy could go a long way toward fighting poverty,pos

tps for the children tssc advisor scott dickson joined forces with amy taylor clinical manager of gastroenterology and other members of the staff at children s health in dallas to find a solution to the problem of central line associated blood stream infections children s health staff meet daily to review and tweak their processes in keeping with the principles of the toyota production system the hospital employs quantitiave methods to track their progress and identify opportunities for further improvement scott dickson has enjoyed a very rewarding career over his years with toyota including the past five as a senior advisor in the toyota production system support center tssc but he s happy to admit that his collaboration with four children s hospitals in was especially meaningful when you see a sick child at a hospital it gets pretty emotional says dickson if there s any way we can do something to help them we re going to do it i felt very blessed to get to do this in this instance dickson s work put him in partnership with children s health in dallas cook children s hospital in fort worth texas children s hospital in cincinnati ohio and children s hospital of kings daughter in norfolk virginia all shared a similar challenge far too often young patients fitted with a central line a plastic tube placed in a large vein that routes to the heart were contracting infections in medical speak such events are referred to as central line associated bloodstream infections or clabsis according to a study published in the approximately clabsis occur annually at hospitals across the country these infections are serious but often can be treated successfully however such countermeasures cost more than billion annually according to a study published in theall four of the institutions in the tssc project were baffled and frustrated by this persistent issue after all doctors and nurses at each hospital were following strict hygiene protocols yet somehow harmful bacteria as well as other germs were getting past their defenses in keeping with the tps principle of or go and see dickson spent time at each hospital observing and taking notes that unbiased perspective proved to be the turning point in each case healthcare practitioners were following the proper steps to ensure they were germ free but the rooms in which the children were being treated that was a very different story so for example while a nurse might don sterile gloves to operate a medical device he or she might inadvertently place that device on a counter or blanket that was not sterile what they thought was the problem and what was actually the problem turned out to be very different things says dickson there s no way we would have figured it out if we hadn t spent time at each site and talked with the nurses on the floor once they d identified the culprit dickson said the next step was to apply toyota s problem solving methodology to come up with a solution then it applied tps standardization principles so that everyone who might come in contact with patients knew exactly what steps to follow that included the use of sterile pads to serve as a barrier between a potentially contaminated surface and the medical devices being used to treat the children such as the chest hubs that are often used in such circumstances the way we systemically break down a problem was completely foreign to the people at the hospitals says dickson in the end their reaction was oh my gosh we never thought of that through the first six months of full implementation the objective was to reduce the number of clabsis by percent at the four hospitals it s now been more than a year and infections are down percent says dickson they re absolutely thrilled with the progress we ve made and if at all possible looking to eliminate these infections all together in keeping with tssc s mission dickson says he s helped the hospital partners integrate tps principles into their ongoing operations so that they can isolate and solve other problems on their own without toyota s help they ve standardized the process he says every floor has a visual board where they track their progress they do audits and they have a huddle meeting every morning to discuss any events that might have occurred the day before they problem solve them immediately before they depended on monthly reports it all comes back to how we observe and think and then teaching them how to observe and think he adds tps works and not just in manufacturing i ve been very fortunate to be involved in many of these projects but when you can do something to help children it does make it even more special,pos

how detroit tigers pitcher matt boyd is saving girls in uganda these are the children of detroit tigers pitcher matthew boyd one of the girls was working as a sex worker at a bar when she was saved another was sold into marriage when she was and her husband forced her into prostitution and a third girl was abandoned by her mother after delivery and left on a road matt and his wife ashley have essentially adopted girls in uganda trying to protect them from the sex slave industry the boyds buy the girls food and clothing and rent for their home and get them sandals and pray for them and worry about them and make sure they are safe the mission is massive and jaw dropping in its scope and goal this isn t just another professional athlete slapping his name on a charity the boyds have created their own nonprofit kingdom home completing the process a few weeks ago it was exhausting time consuming work the boyds are raising money to buy land to expand in uganda over the next three years they want to build four new homes so they can bring in more girls because the need is so great you know what matt says we can end child sex trafficking in uganda the bad guys aren t smarter than us we can end this we can outsmart them we can beat them to the kids we can protect them to do that they have to raise money because this mission has grown bigger than they ever imagined and that is why matt is here strolling through the concourse at joker marchant stadium still wearing his cleats looking out of place in his uniform mingling with the fans like he got lost on his way to the dugout before the start of an exhibition game in lakeland florida the spring training home of the tigers heads turn is that matt boyd what s he doing up here are you allowed to do this ashley asks i asked gardy and he said i could matt says of tigers manager ron gardenhire the tigers organization has been extremely supportive of the boyds passion to help these girls giving them support advice and assistance ok she says if gardy says so then you are good it is early march and a crowd begins to swell as the boyds start selling tickets to a march fundraiser at topgolf in tampa trying to raise money for kingdom home they will hold another fundraiser may at topgolf in auburn hills we are hoping to raise at this event in tampa we are shooting for the stars here ashley says the whole tigers team is coming the boyds have jumped headfirst into a complicated global issue that made headlines recently when a sex trafficking ring was discovered in jupiter florida that allegedly had been servicing high profile names like robert kraft the billionaire owner of the new england patriots kraft pleaded not guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution an estimated million adults and million children were victims of forced sexual exploitation in according to a study from the united nations international labor organization but the boyds are trying to fight this issue from the other side trying to protect the kids who are most vulnerable once a sick kid himself tigers matthew boyd now inspires others what are we supposed to do it started one year ago during spring training ashley and matt were sitting shoulder to shoulder on a couch in a rented house in lakeland talking to carl ralston the director of remember nhu a nonprofit that works to prevent child sex slavery around the world by sponsoring homes in countries we were on skype or maybe it was facetime ashley boyd said ralston told the boyds about dorothy stella alue a woman in uganda who was giving shelter to girls but she fell into a financial crisis after her husband died she lost her home and desperately needed help ralston gets requests like this constantly upon further screening nine times out of red flags pop up and ralston declines to help but ralston said that dorothy s situation checked out perfectly he just laid out her story ashley said we didn t know where he was going with it maybe he s just going to ask for money i don t know but then he actually asked if we would wanted to start our own organization to support them we were shocked it wasn t something we expected there was something appealing about it matt and ashley have a deep christian faith and were searching for a way to serve but it was tantalizing confusing and frightening we said we want to think about it pray about it ashley said we are trying to figure out how to run our own lives let alone a nonprofit organization we didn t immediately jump on it it was also very daunting we just brought our first child into the world and now here we are going to be responsible for children in uganda at the time matt was entering his third season with the tigers a team on the rebuild he is not a superstar but he s got a massive heart and wanted to use his platform for something good family faith helped matthew boyd raise his game for the tigers ashley had always felt a calling to help others like there was a fire burning deep inside her she had worked for remember nhu out of college but they just had a girl meira who is now ashley and matt are a great young couple ralston said when they heard that dorothy s husband unexpectedly passed away and that the children literally were struggling to have food to eat their hearts went out to the children and dorothy ashley and matt listened very intently and asked great questions about the situation and how they could help the more the boyds thought about it the more they prayed about it they came to a realization this is what we were supposed to do ashley said that was the start of something way bigger than we ever would have known that started a whirlwind of phone calls emails and conference calls who exactly was dorothy who were these girls how much danger were they in what do they need and how does somebody set up a nonprofit how does this even work ashley boyd said it was so quick life in uganda dorothy a year old mother of three children said she started the home seven years ago with her husband after they rescued girls who were being ferried to a city to work as commercial sex workers she kept finding all of these girls who had been rescued out of situations who had nowhere to go ashley said so she and her husband took them in just decided to let this be their mission some of the girls were rescued from the sex trade others from female genital mutilation and forced early marriages others were abandoned or orphaned dorothy had lost her house after her husband died in july my in laws became wild and turned against me dorothy wrote in an email to the free press i just lost everything including my academic credentials they burnt down my house with everything that belonged to me even my id card i just had to apply for a new one this was because they knew i would inherit my husband s portion of land which they did not want i moved to a nearby small town and rented a house where i was staying with the girls the rented house didn t have running water the girls had to walk kilometers or about miles every day to a river to get fresh water dorothy had no source of income to feed clothe pay school fees or pay for medical bills for the girls she was thinking about abandoning the girls until she reached out in desperation to remember nhu and passed the screening process dorothy is amazing ashley said she has a heart for rescuing girls it kind of stems back to her personal history she was going to be sold as a childhood bride to her neighbor she was a little girl dorothy was a victim of female genital mutilation when she was before she had healed from the process her parents received cows and goats from a year old man which were meant to be my bride price dorothy said she ran away from home and found refuge at a catholic church at the church i found a kindhearted and loving nun who upon hearing my story had compassion over me dorothy said she took me to live with her friend in kampala uganda s capital city dorothy has made it her life mission to help children and her mission became the boyds mission they loved the girls from the first time they read our story dorothy said they devoted themselves to helping us by offering us shelter food education by paying the girls school fees and even spiritual nurture ashley has a methodical brain like a lawyer but a heart for social issues she went into hyper speed working to create an organization raising money going on conference calls doing research and getting supplies trying to help in the short term while creating a long term plan matt and ashley have brought a very big difference to me and the girls too dorothy said initially we didn t have a good home but now we have a home though rented but it s a good place i could not afford buying clothes for the girls but through these wonderful couple the girls have clothes and even sandals under their feet we now have three meals every day because of matt and ashley we have water running on our tap we no longer walk the long journey we used to walk in search for water the girls have good beds and beddings to sleep on they have balls to play with which were brought by matt and ashley they go to school in uniform just like the other children we just feel at home all courtesy of matt and ashley there is a lot matt and ashley are planning to do for us and we just thank them so much and pray for them dorothy calls matt and ashley god sent ashley calls dorothy amazing she has devoted her life to helping others ashley said she chooses joy for the children she knows she must be a mother to them all and show them the love every child deserves being a mother myself i know this can be exhausting to give so much of yourself but she does it with a constant smile she is also a beacon of light to her community people come to her daily to take on more children or for help in other ways because they know what kind of person she is the boyds visit after the tigers season ashley and matt traveled to uganda to visit the girls but matt wasn t exactly comfortable you are going through areas where it looks like a jason bourne movie he said that s the best way to describe it it s scary for the safety of the girls we don t want to say where the home is it s special you come back and it puts things in perspective ashley laughed when she heard matt s description of uganda it s so funny ashley said he was on edge the whole time he was jason bourne the whole time meanwhile i feel at home it was wonderful i felt at peace uganda is beautiful it s very lush green rolling hills super fertile ground lots of beautiful wild flowers nothing you would see anywhere else it s just incredible the l shaped house is surrounded by a security fence several bedrooms have bunk beds when matt and ashley arrived the girls burst out singing it was a long awaited visit that the girls really yearned for dorothy said they were so happy to see them some of them could not control their tears as they burst into songs of prayer and thanksgiving to the girls matt and ashley are their dad and mom the boyds gave every girl a backpack a new pair of shoes and school supplies a church donated homemade dresses for every girl it was christmas on steroids ashley said it was so fun but they were so respectful we would hand it to them and they would like curtsy like thank you they would walk away and show their friends all giddy ah you know it was really cute we came the next day and they were in their new dresses and shoes and they made a song for us the boyds also brought along letters from the girls sponsors anyone can sponsor a girl with a a month donation about a quarter of the girls are fully sponsored half are partially sponsored the girls loved the letters ashley said they loved seeing the pictures and reading about their families that are supporting them and yes matt gave out some baseballs it was amazing being there seeing the girls be so happy just like any other kid should matt said every day that the boyds visited the home the girls would sing and dance like we were their honored guest which is so humbling ashley said but just to get to know the girls i knew their stories and i felt like i knew them but to meet them and spend time with them and talk to them and see them interact with each other it was really cool to see each of their different personalities they live a world away and they have been through things that i could never relate to but at the end of the day we are all human there are the girls who are the natural leaders there are the girls who are the natural caregivers who looked after the younger ones the girls who loved sports the other ones who love crafts it was cool to see their different personalities we care for them like they are our own they are part of our family we love them like our own family ashley as matt says is the brains of the operation dorothy and i are constantly talking back and forth on emails we ll talk about everything ashley said we sent the wire today how are the girls doing on their winter vacation hey is so and so feeling better i remember she had the flu will you fill out the budget we hold her accountable to fill out spreadsheets how she uses the funds ashley said we are pretty involved in knowing what is going on in their day to day lives you gotta be thankful for technology in that regard they plan to go back to uganda next fall after the tigers season we are hoping to bring a group this time whether it s sponsors or donors ashley said the boyds are giving these girls more than a safe place to live they are trying to prepare them for life the girls do chores washing clothes or washing dishes the boyds plan to implement a vocational training program and will pay for each child to attend a university if they choose that route our goal is for them to no longer be at risk for child sex slavery ashley said if we give them a skill and a value beyond selling their bodies they will be successful and we will reach our goal but the boyds as well as dorothy worry about other girls in uganda who are being married off at a young age many of the marriages don t work out and so the girls run away to brothels to work as sex workers in order to earn a living and also provide for the children they got from the broken marriages dorothy said some have contracted sexual related diseases like hiv aids and have died their lives are miserable they cannot afford the basic needs they don t go to school sometimes i just wish i got a big place and resources too to accommodate and reach out to many whom i have personally met and shared their stories with me some want to go to school but they cannot afford it they have nowhere to stay especially those who are orphaned some have turned to the streets they have no shelter no food no clothes and no one to listen to them some have turned into thieves snatching people s property due to this they are beaten even to death the boyds home in uganda is filled to capacity so they want to expand we will need new dorothys and new aunties but we are turning people away at this point we are hoping that won t be the case for too long ashley said and it s only going to get more complicated the boyds recently announced that ashley is now expecting her second child a boy and the boyds now carry a mixture of emotions the joy of helping others and the stress of such a massive responsibility worrying about girls on the other side of the world we love them all like our own family ashley said this is such a remarkable young couple doing such a remarkable thing they feel responsibility to care for the children and protect them and to set them on the right path we can end child sex trafficking in uganda matt repeats his eyes tighten and he has such a determined look no different than when he s on the mound but they can t do it on their own how to help matthew and ashley boyd founded kingdom home with a mission to end child sex slavery

healthcare share ge healthcare industrial designers erik kemper left and doug dietz helped develop the idea of transforming the often frightening process of mri and ct scans into an adventure for children mark hoffman by of the waukesha the sight of a terrified little girl about to have an mri scan gave doug dietz a different perspective on his work as an industrial designer at ge healthcare and led to a project that has turned imaging departments at children s hospitals into small theme parks the idea that eventually emerged from a mix of brainstorming and research with some persistence thrown in was to transform a frightening medical test into a voyage on a spaceship a visit to a pirate island and other adventures imaging departments became elaborate sets technicians became amateur actors with scripts and children were given starring roles children would cling to their mom s leg and start crying and you would have to pry them off said kathleen kapsin radiology director of children s hospital of pittsburgh part of the university of pittsburgh medical center now they walk in and they are excited imagine being a year old child about to be fed into the bore of a large noisy machine and then being told not to move for minutes minutes or longer that s what computerized tomography magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography commonly known as ct mri and pet scans entail even some adults panic in mris with small bores or openings children often told the designers at ge healthcare that the bore of the machine was the scariest part of the room one of our designers said it looks like everything your mother told you stay away from said erik kemper also a designer children s hospital of pittsburgh had to sedate almost every child younger than who needed an mri scan kapsin said and more than of the children who needed a ct scan an mri scan typically lasts more than minutes a ct scan about minutes sedating a child meant calling an anesthesiologist and administering medication through an intravenous line children would be terrified parents would be worried and the hospital s expensive imaging equipment could do far fewer scans each day that was before the hospital worked with ge healthcare to come up with what is now known as the adventure series fewer than of the children who needed mris and fewer than of the children who needed ct scans had to be sedated in the fiscal year ended june kapsin said the genesis of the idea for the adventure series came from dietz s visiting a children s hospital to see an mri machine that he had helped design during the visit he saw a terrified girl clinging to her parents before a scan it just broke my heart dietz said it was just an awful experience he remembers her parents catching each other s eyes you could tell they didn t know what to do to help their daughter get through this experience he said dietz realized that he and the other industrial designers in waukesha needed to use their skills to improve the patient s experience during imaging tests children s hospital of pittsburgh which had learned that finding ways to distract children lessened the need for sedation was intrigued there is nothing like one of your main customers telling you this is a great idea dietz said their timing was just perfect children s hospital of pittsburgh would become a key partner with its interest making the project a priority the designers in waukesha one of ge healthcare s five design studios worldwide work in a large open somewhat disheveled room it is a place where people still use pencils and occasionally even crayons the first brainstorming session took place at a day care center dietz made bag lunches for the designers they then talked to doctors staff at the betty brinn children s museum in milwaukee and more children there was no one moment when someone came up with the idea for the adventure series instead the idea gradually took shape variety of themes the series consists of a variety of themes for the different tests for an mri it is a space voyage with technicians telling children that the spaceship is about to go into hyper drive when the machine becomes loud for a pet scan it is camp cozy because children need to be calm and the test takes about minutes ge healthcare also has developed themes for specific hospitals for a children s hospital in san francisco for example it designed a theme around cable cars jwd creative a milwaukee ad agency helped write the scripts and develop the artwork for the adventure series part of the process is preparing kids for the scan such as giving them coloring books tied to the theme the day before the test we used the children s imagination to our advantage said kapsin of children s hospital of pittsburgh instead going to the ct scanner you are going to pirate island and when you go in we have a monkey on a swing so they can play with the monkey ge healthcare estimates that the adventure series costs to for each room with imaging equipment the biggest expense can be goggles without any metal parts that can work inside an mri machine the goggles which cost about enable a child to watch a dvd tied to the theme or one of his or her choice the cost can be more than offset however if a hospital can do more scans a day and doesn t have to buy another mri or ct pet scanner the best way to keep a child motionless is to keep them engaged and entertained kapsin said the technicians at children s hospital of pittsburgh initially were skeptical of the idea that quickly passed we saw children excited and children happy instead of crying and upset kapsin said the technicians soon started getting into the role playing wearing scrubs that matched the theme and suggesting toys tied to the theme to give the children at the end of the scan the project now is cited as a model of innovation dietz has given ted talks on creativity and been featured in a book by tom and david kelley of ideo an international design firm in palo alto calif he also can tell a story about hearing a child asking her parents after a scan if they could do it again tomorrow that probably was the biggest reward i could ever have he said,pos

the jaw dropping story behind an nfl coach s search for his family runs in the family kansas city chiefs running backs coach deland mccullough went searching for his biological parents he found them where he never would have expected e by sarah spain illustration by jonathan bartlett for espn carol briggs placed her newborn son on the bed and removed all of his clothes she tried to find herself in his face searching his mouth his nose his eyes not yet she thought she saw only his father she looked him up and down making a mental note of each of his tiny toes chubby legs puffy belly and two little arms reaching up at her in my mind briggs says that was probably going to be the last time i ever saw him it was dec and a big snowstorm had hit the greater pittsburgh area that week briggs had gone sledding with some of the other girls the night before dragging a cardboard box up and down a big hill that emptied out right at the zoar home for mothers babies and convalescents in allison park pennsylvania she woke up in labor around a m and just minutes later she was a mother she named her baby jon kenneth briggs her parents and older brother drove the hour from her hometown of youngstown ohio to be with her at the hospital after cleaning out her room at the maternity home and signing some papers she was back in ohio the next day ready to resume her life as a year old high schooler and national honor society member no one outside of her immediate family and her cousin robin knew about the baby only when she was preparing to sign the adoption papers did briggs consider sharing the news with the father a teenage fling who had gone off to college before she discovered she was pregnant she ultimately decided against it he was a kid too she says he was off at college on a scholarship i think i may have felt that i kind of got myself in this i m gonna do what i need to do to work my way through it with her parents blessing briggs had decided that when the child was born she would put him up for adoption my mother was still cleaning up my room for me once a week she says i wasn t in a position to be anybody s mother i thought this was best for him that i allow him to be placed with some family that would be able to give him all the great things that i had coming up because i had a mother and a father i just didn t want him to get cheated out of anything in her last interaction with the adoption agency briggs was told that baby jon had been placed with a doctor and his wife in columbus ohio in early now kansas city chiefs running backs coach deland mccullough signed on to coach the running backs at usc having spent the previous six years in the same position at indiana university a few months before making the move to southern california he and his wife darnell welcomed their fourth son into the world for the fourth time the couple provided doctors with darnell s medical history but couldn t do the same for deland s side of the family at years old mccullough knew nothing about where he came from growing up in youngstown his adoptive mother adelle comer could tell him only that he was adopted at a very young age and that she had no information about his birth parents for a long time that was enough mccullough wasn t interested in finding them anyway there was enough trouble in youngstown those days and he didn t want to burden anyone who might have bigger things to worry about things changed when he had his first child and as his family grew so too did his desire to know of his past he wanted to know who gave him his deep voice and his muscular build and to whom he owed his pensive nature and quiet intensity he wondered where son dason got his height and which grandfather or uncle his bespectacled son daeh might favor he was so hungry for information that he never questioned whether the search might lead him to answers he couldn t handle i didn t know what was going to happen mccullough says i didn t know how people would receive things one way or another i didn t have a plan i just knew i wanted to find out new laws in ohio and pennsylvania had called for the unsealing of adoption records giving mccullough new hope that he might find his birth parents in november more than a year after filling out the requisite paperwork and years after his search began he finally received his adoption files in the mail for the first time he saw his original birth certificate complete with his name jon kenneth briggs and the name of his mother carol denise briggs there was no information about his father adelle comer was living in a three bedroom house on a cul de sac in youngstown with her husband popular local radio host a c mccullough and their young son damon when she got the call it was a social worker reaching out to see whether she and a c would come see an infant at an adoption agency in pennsylvania not long after the tragic death of their second son alex who died of an intestinal birth defect after just days the young couple had started serving as foster parents and they were looking to adopt in january they met week old baby jon he was asleep in a bassinet comer says and she put him in my arms and when he woke up his eyes were looking straight at me it was instant connection love mother son by march of that year jon kenneth briggs had been renamed deland scott mccullough and he was living at home with his new parents adelle and a c we were still in love a good couple comer says we went to church partied went to cookouts we were working together and doing this together and wanting to make a home for our children we knew that god s hand was in it deland came so fast to us we knew that it was meant to be both of us but things changed quickly comer s father had a stroke and though a c wanted to put him in a nursing home comer brought her dad to live with the family in youngstown their marriage deteriorated and when deland was just years old a c moved out they went through a lot of hurt and disappointment but they took it comer says of her sons i said god gives you an example of what to be and what not to be you have to make the choice and that s all i had to say and they got it when deland was in elementary school comer came home to find that he had cut three gashes into the couch for which she had just finished two years of layaway payments kids at school had been teasing him about being adopted and he accused comer of loving him less than her birth son damon she explained that she loved the two boys differently one because he had been in her belly and the other because she had chosen him after that deland mccullough rarely spoke of his adoption he got good at pretending to be whole the void was there he says i wish that it wasn t but i think i did a good job of hiding it after the divorce comer had relationships with a few other men some of whom were combative and abusive some men don t understand what respect is she says i ve got two sons and i m not gonna allow my children to grow up with this type of lifestyle this drama damon sometimes tried to physically defend her but then he left for college and deland felt too small physically and emotionally to step in his response to the violence was to try to tune it out become emotionless put blinders on and dream of a way out of the house and out of youngstown comer acknowledges that she contributed to the chaos in her own way as well biggest drama queen in the world ok she says they called me ma barker because i d shoot you and ask questions later comer took deland with her to therapy for a while hoping to make things at home a little less turbulent new boyfriends came and went but she mostly settled into life as a single mom taking on multiple jobs to support her sons including as a switchboard operator at the cuyahoga county department of human services a waitress a social worker and a short order cook at the local bowling alley she did her best to rear the boys on her own but they moved a lot and she struggled to pay the bills sometimes having to choose between electricity and a working phone but comer stressed the importance of an education insisting that she see the boys homework to make sure they were taking it seriously she taught them the value of a dollar and the importance of faith demanding that they use a portion of their monthly child support for sunday school and tithes at church and she was always shuttling them to activities from the theater program at the youngstown playhouse to football basketball and track practices deland was a bit of a late bloomer in terms of talent but the passion for football was always there early on in pee wee he heard his name over the loudspeaker and a light went off in his head he fell in love with the game and started carrying a football with him everywhere he went even to bed it was an escape he says when i was out there practicing you didn t think about the electric is off you know you didn t even think about anything like that you were just out there balling doing your thing and competing and bonding with your friends comer was a one woman cheer squad bringing multiple signs to deland s games and running up and down the sideline rooting him on one night when her ride didn t show up she took her son s moped to the game he looked up in the stands and saw her still wearing his moped helmet hollering and screaming for him d mack d mack as a junior defensive back deland saw himself playing football at a small school or enlisting in the navy but an opportunity to show his talent at the running back position his senior year drew the eye of college recruiters suddenly he was being pursued by the likes of jim tressel then the head coach at youngstown state bob stoops then the defensive backs coach at kansas state and sherman smith then the running backs coach at miami of ohio deland mccullough looked out the window of his third period english class at campbell memorial high school and saw a tall man emerge from a candy apple red mercedes benz with tan interior and tricked out gold rims a few minutes later he got a pink slip message to leave class and go to the office where the tall man stuck out his hand and said with a firm handshake i m sherman smith the running backs coach at miami university a former star quarterback at miami smith was a second round draft pick at running back for the seahawks and went on to play eight years in the nfl he had a booming voice thick arms and broad square shoulders he walked and talked and carried himself like a former pro mccullough was immediately drawn to him it was just something about his personality mccullough says the way he presented himself he had things that i hadn t seen out of a man or mentor he was on top of his details he was successful he had played in the nfl he got his degree i wasn t around that type of person the mercedes was nice too you know he laughed that was slick as a youngstown native himself smith thought guys from the area were tough but the coaches told him mccullough was special a thin kid but when he couldn t run around people he d go through them mccullough was serious that day in the office offering few smiles and answering with a lot of yes sir and no sir but he was also intelligent and expressive smith thought he d very much like to work with him the feeling was mutual despite interest from other schools the decision to attend miami university was easy for mccullough especially after the home visit during which smith charmed comer as well well coach smith was hard not to love comer says laughing i fell in love with him the first time he was just a gentleman and he was very attentive and respectful to me smith drove them to visit the school and was back at campbell memorial a few months later for signing day when mccullough signed his letter of intent to play at miami when mccullough arrived on campus the coaches tried to turn him into a wide receiver but he pushed for an opportunity to work with smith and the running backs accepting a redshirt freshman year to pursue the position he believed he was meant to play i would tell the players you may not be looking for a father but i m going to treat you like you re my sons smith says and so i just looked at every guy like my son i just wanted to be a positive role model for deland and exemplify what i thought my father exemplified for me he was everything mccullough says if anything was going on i was going to talk to coach smith everybody in that room gravitated towards coach smith just because that s the type of person he was what he s about rubs off on you so i always wanted to be around that smith left miami university after that season to be the tight ends coach at the university of illinois but he and mccullough stayed in touch he watched from afar as mccullough put together a hall of fame career in oxford rushing touchdowns and setting a school record with rushing yards mccullough was surprised when his name wasn t called in the draft but he was invited to a few workouts and ended up signing with the bengals he was leading the nfl in preseason rushing before he suffered a season ending knee injury in cincinnati s final exhibition game after a few more looks in the nfl a couple of seasons in canada several more knee surgeries and a brief flirtation with the xfl mccullough finally accepted in that the dream of pro football was over a few years later married and the father of one son mccullough took a job teaching communications and coaching football at harmony community school in cincinnati despite rising to the ranks of principal and making a good salary his first taste of coaching gave him the itch to coach full time and he reached out to his alma mater about an opportunity to join the staff smith had followed a similar path first teaching and coaching high schoolers then working his way up the ranks from miami university to the university of illinois the houston oilers the washington redskins and finally the running backs coach for the seahawks he was with seattle when he got a call from mccullough asking for advice as he started his new job at miami university by mccullough was coaching at indiana university and the two were reunited on the field as smith welcomed mccullough to seattle for a coaching internship he saw firsthand that his former player had a real future on the sideline he had no idea that off the field mccullough was consumed by the search for his family a few days before thanksgiving carol briggs got home from work sat down on the couch and opened a facebook message from an unfamiliar man did you have a baby in in allegheny county that you placed for adoption luckily i was already sitting she says briggs had thought often of baby jon every year she wished him a happy birthday on her facebook wall and she regularly searched adoption websites to see if he might be looking for her briggs could still hear her mother s voice saying more and more often in the years before she died you need to find that boy never married and without any other children briggs would joke to her cousin robin that one day baby jon might show up at her door and walk in to find her home alone dancing around the house to funkadelic she called her older brother who warned her that the message might be from someone trying to bribe or extort her she responded anyway and after a few short messages she agreed to speak to mccullough on the phone that night after he got out of practice in the hours before the call she googled his name and read every article she could find she stared at his pictures and tried to find herself in his face it wasn t hard to see it now the mouth the nose the eyes mccullough called briggs from a hallway at usc as he awaited the start of a football family dinner they spoke as if they d known each other for years an easy back and forth as they shared where life had taken them in the years since she d laid him down on that bed and let him go she learned that he had never gone to live with a doctor in columbus that in fact they had been just a few miles away from each other in youngstown for all of mccullough s childhood she likely shopped at the same grocery store as adelle comer perhaps even passing young mccullough in the aisles she was certain that her sports fanatic father now deceased had read about mccullough s high school exploits in the paper mccullough was overjoyed to find his birth mother though a mother had never been what he was missing within probably the first five or six minutes he says who is my father briggs says she took a breath she had probably told only three people the man s name after making the decision to not tell the father all those years ago she had been determined to never let him learn of the baby years later because of careless gossip she hesitated but decided mccullough had a right to know your father s name is sherman smith briggs told him mccullough leaning against a wall in the hallway felt as though he might pass out he started flashing back to all of his memories with smith and all the times people had joked about him being a carbon copy of his coach throughout college when he returned to coach at miami university during his internship with the seahawks man you and coach smith look alike man you all walk alike y all this y all this mccullough says there s no reason to connect those dots because you weren t even thinking about them a sense of pride that went through me like wow that explains these things and then i also start thinking about all the similarities of our path that just blew me away not only had he known his father for years but smith was also his mentor the man he had looked up to since he was years old mccullough thought of a photo of him and smith at campbell memorial high both beaming as he signed his letter of intent to play at miami university the same photo he had pinned to the corkboard that hung in his college dorm room the same photo that was at that moment sitting in a ziploc bag in the drawer of his nightside table a bag that had traveled with him through every job and every move if you would have told me to pick who my father was there s no way i would have picked him because i might have thought i wasn t worthy for him to be my father mccullough says i felt like my blessings came full circle because i d always wanted to be somebody like him i could hear him take a big breath briggs says and i could kind of hear him choke up a little and finally he says well i ve known sherman my whole life the next morning mccullough texted smith asking if they could talk about something important it was november and smith assumed that mccullough had gotten a coaching opportunity he wanted to discuss instead mccullough began by talking about his search for his birth parents how he had found his biological mother and she was from youngstown just like them praise the lord smith recalls saying what a blessing and then he said i asked her who my biological father was and she said you smith was quiet sixty three years old he had been married to his college sweetheart for years and had reared a grown son and a daughter he hadn t heard the name carol briggs in more than four decades he never knew she was pregnant never knew there was a baby he knew he couldn t deny the possibility that he was mccullough s father but he wanted proof even more he wanted time to think he asked mccullough if he could call him back later stunned and a little hurt mccullough agreed smith sat in his office guilt washed over him even though he hadn t been told about the baby he couldn t shake the feeling that he had let briggs and mccullough down he felt awful that he had left briggs in such a difficult position and regretted all the years he had missed out on being a father to mccullough he had built a life making a difference in young men s lives he had spoken to his athletes and his kids about being responsible being accountable being irresponsible is not neutral smith says when you re irresponsible someone becomes responsible for what you ve been irresponsible for he thought about what this would say about him as a man and found himself hoping that a paternity test would show that he wasn t mccullough s father it was a thought that brought him only more guilt he asked to speak to briggs briggs cried her way through work the day she was set to talk to smith i hadn t talked to sherman in years and after years this is probably not the icebreaker conversation that you want to have with the guy that you used to fool around with hey we ve got a year old son and how are you so no i wasn t looking forward to that at all not at all there was no need to worry smith was calm and kind and the two settled into a nice conversation catching up for a long time before they even got to talking about mccullough smith apologized to her for her having to make such a difficult decision at such a young age and briggs explained why she had felt it was best to not tell smith about the baby she said that over the years she just wanted to know that mccullough was ok and smith reassured her that her son was a good man briggs hung up full of emotion but relieved that smith wasn t angry with her smith hung up feeling much more certain that mccullough was his son smith talked to his wife sharon and his brother vincent he talked to his children sherman and shavonne he thought about mccullough s coaching internship a few years earlier how seahawks assistant offensive line coach pat ruel hadn t stopped cracking jokes about smith and his protege acting like a father son duo mccullough sent smith an old article from his days in the cfl and smith couldn t believe his eyes i m looking at this thing and thinking i don t remember taking this picture i don t remember doing this article smith says i m looking at deland and i m thinking it s me that got me i called my aunt in youngstown and i told her about it and she d went on youtube and pulled up some pictures of deland and she called me back she said nephew i can save you the money on the dna tests the more smith thought about it the more he realized the story wasn t about him and his guilt it was about mccullough and what he had been through it was about a life without a father about the years mccullough had spent looking for his birth parents hoping to fill a void wanting to know where he d come from it was said that humility is not thinking less of yourself it s thinking of yourself less smith says i started thinking about deland sometime in the weeks between that first phone call and the test results smith realized that he was hoping he was mccullough s father that in fact he would be devastated if the results came back otherwise when the test came in it showed a percent chance that smith was indeed mccullough s father both were elated i look at it and i just say it s a god thing smith says it s grace it s undeserved and that s what s made it great for deland and for all of us how everyone has embraced this and is excited about our new family mccullough understood why smith had been so curt at first mccullough had spent his whole life wondering about his birth parents briggs had spent her whole life wondering about her child smith had gone from zero to a year old son in one phone call he needed time deland mccullough gathered with his biological parents his adoptive mother and his extended family at a reunion in july ruddy roye for espn a few weeks after the paternity test came back mccullough had a recruiting trip near nashville where smith and his wife had relocated after his retirement mccullough made a special trip to see the man he now knew as his father i m pretty sure he was nervous smith says of that day i laugh because i m looking out the window because i know he s supposed to be coming i m standing there and i see he parks at the corner down there and he s parked there for five minutes i said what s he doing he finally pulls up and gets out the car as mccullough walked up the steps to the house smith greeted him with open arms and said my son it was the first time in mccullough s life that anyone had called him that for so many years that i was around him the embrace was hey coach how you doing smith says but this is man my son maybe i was doing it for me to help me really fully understand i know he was saying it from a place of i m proud this is my son mccullough says i d never heard that i d never been referred to like that before period it really hit me hard emotionally when i sit here at this point and i m looking at the things that i ve done i m happy that i m able to be somebody that he s proud of at first mccullough was concerned that his adoptive mother might be upset by his relationships with his birth parents but as soon as he heard that briggs and comer had hit it off in their first phone call he knew everything would be fine all i can say is are you serious over and over again are you serious comer says of mccullough s journey leading to smith it s just a miracle that his birth father s been in his life since he was years old that s my son and i want nothing but percent best for him he needed that and god gave it to him and it s in god s time both smith and briggs are endlessly grateful to comer for raising mccullough with the wisdom they didn t yet have she did what i couldn t do briggs says of comer she was an adult she was married at the time so you know she brought him into a family structure that was what i wanted for him i wanted him to have what i had and she gave him that she gave him all the tools that he needed in growing up to be the successful man that he is right now this past june the two miami university hall of famers smith and mccullough were back on campus to witness the verbal commitment of mccullough s son deland mccullough ii to the redhawks football team the younger mccullough is a defensive back just like smith s son sherman who played the position at miami as well in july a huge family reunion in youngstown brought mccullough briggs smith and comer together for the first time all of mccullough s parents in one place reflecting on nurture versus nature what is inherited versus what is taught and the many different forms of parenthood it was both the culmination of a journey and the start of something new for the families that the journey had introduced a man found his parents a mother found her child and a father discovered a son he never knew he was missing there is no jealousy no resentment and no regret there is just gratitude for the winding paths that brought them all together when i look at deland the type of guy he is it was a gift to us smith says and to think deland felt we were a gift to him now i know who i am and where i m from mccullough says i got all of the pieces to the story i got them all now sarah spainsarah spain is the co host of spain and company on espn radio host of the that s what she said podcast a sportscenter reporter and an espnw columnist since

financial hurdle gone alberta first province to eliminate fees for addiction recovery programs after years sober he lost his house all his savings and sold all the equipment he owned to pay for alcohol then lloydminster senior bryan robinson was staring down a bill for a day addiction recovery program his son came to his aid paying the tab for his time at the thorpe recovery centre i knew i had to get well he said in an interview on friday i knew i had to get better now in a long term program at our house addiction recovery centre in west edmonton he s been paying a month from his old age security and canadian pension plan benefits but this month and beyond his bill will be that s due to a major shift in the way the alberta government is funding addictions recovery for the first time the province has eliminated fees for people to attend the licensed publicly funded treatment centres in the province the daily cost for room and board will be covered for everyone who does not have health insurance plans that would cover the cost associate minister of mental health and addictions jason luan said it s been a goal of his team since the united conservative party took office i think we are contributing to a transformational change in the sector he said i wouldn t mind to say our major step forward this milestone will signal another best practice that we hope will lead the country with our numbers with our evidence luan said families shouldn t have to sell a vehicle or refinance a mortgage to pay for addictions treatment programs the cost was a huge hurdle and one he wanted to eliminate associate minister of mental health and addictions jason luan says eliminating user fees for residential addiction recovery programs is good value for money cbc he said it s also good economics a report estimated substance use cost alberta billion in to pay for health services police court and corrections costs and in lost productivity every dollar invested in prevention can save another down the road he said his staff calculate the cost at about million a year about million of that will be diverted from the department of community and social services people who qualified for income support or assured income for the severely handicapped aish already had their recovery treatment costs covered by the government although about people in those programs entered recovery each year many people whose lives were in crisis didn t qualify for the help seniors post secondary students and the working poor were left out the point of the policy change is to divert people to recovery programs before they lose everything expanding service key part of plan the loss isn t limited to the person snared by addiction lerena greig helps their families executive director of parents empowering parents society greig has seen families spend their life savings to pay for addiction treatment programs sometimes if a person relapses they may go through detox and treatment two three or four times she s watched parents mental and physical health deteriorate while they carry the stress some have remortgaged their homes to pay she s seen the financial and emotional pressure lead to divorces she said she s ecstatic the financial barrier has been removed that s because the largest barrier to recovery is often the willingness of the person to enter treatment at all with addiction it s kind of like there s a moment of clarity she said and if you don t jump on that moment of clarity when that person decides they want help that moment is gone with financial barriers gone will there be enough treatment beds to take patients in their moments of clarity the government has been working on that luan has pledged to add treatment spaces over four years bringing the total to more than across alberta a space is a bed and staffing to treat patients for one year but most programs are far shorter it s also unclear how successful recovery programs are in the long term the government hopes to begin tracking that the funding changes could also bring more stability to recovery centres which are either non profit or run by alberta health services steven archambault director of community engagement and fund development for simon house recovery centre in calgary said the bed facility is heavily dependent on community donations rather than receiving funding per patient centres will now bid on three year contracts determined by their services and capacity that could make funding more predictable and allow them to expand their offerings archambault said he said the changes are exciting ideally in the long run we hope that the recognition will bring a much better opportunity of lowering the stigma that is attached to addiction throughout the country back in edmonton robinson says saving up his pension earnings is a good first step to preparing for his eventual independence whatever it looks like eventually sooner or later i ve got to start right and it takes money to start or i ll be back to square one again,pos

world first south australia achieves pct solar and lowest prices in australia south australia maligned by conservatives over the world leading share of wind and solar in its grid now boasts the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in the country even as it reaches world first levels of per cent solar power the australian energy market operator in its latest quarterly energy dynamics report confirms that south autralia as first reported exclusively by reneweconomy three months ago served all of its electricity demand for more than an hour shortly after mid day on october through rooftop and utility scale solar aemo says this is a world first in a grid of this size and occurred in a december quarter when south australia posted the lowest wholesale electricity prices in the country thanks to the growing share of wind and solar and the increase in rooftop solar pv which is reducing grid demand south australia s quarterly average price fell per cent to mwh representing its lowest average since q aemo says adding that these continued price reductions were largely a function of its lowest quarterly average demand on record and increased wind and solar output in victoria and south australia mw on average this is important recognition for a state unfairly maligned by conservatives and australia s federal coalition government in particular for its ground breaking shift to wind and solar which critics say had led to the highest electricity prices in the world but the truth is that south australia has long suffered high electricity prices than other states thanks to its former dependence on expensive gas and coal and it began to search for cheaper renewable energy options as far back as the s when wind and solar prices fell dramatically over the past decade it seized the moment and is now reaping the rewards so much so that the state liberal government has set new goals for net per cent renewables by and a per cent renewable energy target by reflecting its desire to export clean energy to neighbouring states and overseas aemo points out that the growth in wind and solar has allowed some states for the first time to break the nexus between gas prices and electricity prices so while gas prices have been going up mostly due to events in international markets local electricity prices have been mostly falling thanks to the increase in wind and solar south australia also posted new record lows for what is termed minimum operating demand the demand not served by the growing amounts of rooftop solar as did victoria wind is now setting the wholesale price more often than before and up to eight per cent of the time in south australia which also continues to experience the most negative pricing events per cent of the time in the last quarter a situation worsened by increasing network constraints and transmission line outages in south australia this resulted in some gas generators trying to shut down to dodge the negative prices and being forced by aemo to stay online but this situation will be dramatically reduced over the coming year as new synchronous condensers which do not burn fuel will come on line and will reduce the need to have gas generators operating at times of high wind and solar output across the main australian grid known as the national electricity market aemo says that increased coal fired generator outages coupled with low operational demand and increased wind and solar shaped the nem supply mix average black coal fired generation decreased by mw over the same period a year earlier reaching its lowest level since late the decline in generation occurred mainly in new south wales which fell to its lowest quarterly average on record a function of increased outages including for unit upgrades low operational demand and displacement by wind and solar gas touted as the essential transition fuel by the federal government fell to its lowest q output since mainly due to lower operational demand and displacement by wind solar and hydro grid solar generation reached a record quarterly high of mw on average surpassing the previous record set in q by mw this was mainly a result of new capacity entering the system over the last year as solar irradiation during the quarter was lower than q average wind generation was mw with the largest increase compared to q occurring in victoria mw followed by queensland mw quarterly nem emissions declined to the lowest quarterly level on record at million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent mtco e while the nem emissions intensity equalled the previous quarterly record low of tonnes of co e per megawatt hour,pos

noah irvine receives national award for his effort to create a national suicide prevention plan irvine accepted the samara canada everyday political citizen award tuesday in toronto noah irvine didn t intend on becoming the poster boy for mental illness and suicide prevention but the guelph teenager is promising to use his new found notoriety to continue to press for change from all levels of government for irvine winning the samara canada everyday political citizen award is one more opportunity for him to push for the creation of a national suicide prevention plan and to advance the discussion on mental illness i never wanted to use my parents deaths to get something in terms of recognition i used it so people could understand what the actual face of mental illness and suicide is in canada said irvine he accepted the award thursday in toronto irvine s story went national this summer when he expressed his displeasure with the lack of response he received after writing letters to every member of parliament in canada challenging them to take action and address the country s suicide crisis since then he has received a personal phone call from the prime minister of canada met with the federal health minister and received a standing ovation from the ontario legislature to name just a few of his achievements irvine doesn t plan on going away or giving any of them a break out of all of this what i have learned is as much as the government will promise a lot it s up to us as canadians to hold them accountable he said irvine said his experience in engaging the conversation at the political level is an example of how democracy should work many politicians promise lots of things and then say they will get back to us but it s up to us to hold them accountable i think i ve done a pretty good job of that he said last year jill goodreau was teaching irvine in her grade intro to psychology sociology and anthropology at gcvi in guelph knowing the history of his family goodreau suggested irvine write a letter about his experiences in the letter irvine explained how he lost his mother to suicide when he was just five years old and about the loss of his father in to mental illness his father was when he died and his mother was just years of age at the time of her suicide at the time the plan wasn t to necessarily send it to anybody but to write it and get a mark he did his research and the letter came back well written and articulate said goodreau she challenged him to actually send the letter off it was irvine s idea to send it to every member of parliament across the country i think by channelling his frustration into the letters he took it beyond what my expectation was said goodreau it was just a pebble that he grew into a mountain she added goodreau said the change she has witnessed in irvine since has been incredible he s gone to speak at other schools about his experience he was the kid that wouldn t do any presentations in class the confidence that it has built and the honouring of his parents has been truly remarkable she said irvine said the experience of writing the letters has given him the encouragement to pursue a university education i had never really considered post secondary at all i have a learning disability and it really affects every facet of how i learn and how i do in school it s only because of this that i realize you may be labelled with something but you can become more than that i think i have proven it he said no final decision has been made but irvine is considering applying for a political science program or history i am doing a lot more than i ever though i could without a high school diploma how much could i do with one and with a university degree he said irvine now lives with his grandparents and credits his entire family with supporting him while he has been dealing with the national spotlight obviously it s not easy to see your brother or your sister on national television and knowing they are not around anymore but some family have told me it s good to know they didn t die for nothing their deaths actually contributed to some form of change some sort of conversation was started because of their deaths said irvine stories like irvine s of students meeting and exceeding their expectations is one of the reasons goodreau said became a teacher and she said she is so proud of his decision to pursue a higher education he has to go into politics i have told him he has to be a political advocate for mental health he has the skills to be able to do that she said irvine was one of four winners in the under category of the samara canada everyday political citizen award and at age this year s youngest recipient samara canada is a charitable organization dedicated to reconnecting citizens to politics kendall anderson managing director of samara canada said irvine is a prime example of an everyday political citizen he took that personal issue and raised it to the political level not everybody who is going to be experiencing the things he experienced will be able to do that so he is really giving a voice to the people who would be otherwise unheard said anderson irvine said it was an honour to have been nominated with such a group of politically engaged young people to be nominated and then to be picked among other people who are doing amazing things for this country moving forward with issues they care about and wanting to do more in their communities i think it s excellent said irvine he said the ceremony will give him an opportunity to meet other young people engaged in the political process irvine also sees the ceremony as an opportunity to get his foot in the door in having face to face conversations with the senators expected to be in attendance irvine has spoken with many members of parliament but so far has met with very few members of the red chamber when you re unelected it s hard to find you they re a little harder to get a hold of said irvine a federal mental health secretariat would provide a spotlight focusing on mental health at the highest levels of government said irvine and he would like to see mental health ministries created within provincial governments goodreau said the fact irvine sees the ceremony as an opportunity to continue to advance the conversation instead of simply accepting praise is one of the things that makes his story so compelling he did not do this to pad a resume or get a course credit this is very real for him she said,pos

reading matters books can make a big difference in a child s life and school performance adults needed by jill barshay the hechinger report literacy experts have long known that reading to toddlers even babies can make a big difference in children s reading abilities later in elementary school but does simply giving away free books to low income families with young children help with early reading an analysis of studies of book giveaway programs concludes that free stuff does work three researchers from the netherlands and australia looked for all the high quality studies they could find on book giveaway programs which reach millions of children under in north america and europe and focused on the ones that compared the early literacy of children who received books with those who didn t despite the large number of studies that made the cut only three giveaway programs were analyzed by all of them bookstart dolly parton s imagination library and reach out and read multiple studies of the same program tested how the program worked with different kids and in different places the three programs are quite different bookstart a program that originated in the united kingdom gives only one or two free books on one or two occasions imagination library launched by american country music star dolly parton mails a new book a month from birth to age reach out and read uses health professionals instead of the postal service pediatricians and nurses hand out books out during regular checkups and are trained to tell parents that reading is important for cognitive development at some health clinics volunteers model effective book reading strategies for parents some of the programs give books to all families who want them regardless of income but the studies mostly focused on low income children the intended target audience all three programs worked when measured by how much parents read to children and by how much kids early literacy skills improved but the program that used healthcare professionals to give out the books and personally tell parents to read them achieved the largest literacy gains participation in any book giveaway program yielded a positive effect said ingrid willenberg one of the researchers by email but we found that programs like reach out and read that involve interaction with parents and provide guidance on how to read showed a greater effect willenberg a senior lecturer at australian catholic university was one of the three authors of the meta analysis do book giveaway programs promote the home literacy environment and children s literacy related behavior and skills published in the journal review of educational research in may the number of free books it turned out didn t matter bookstart which gives away only a few was just as effective as dolly parton s imagination library which gives out books to each child over five years reach out and read distributes about books to each child over the same period what this means is that the giveaway programs don t need to build an entire library for each child to be successful this compilation of research supports the theory that an age appropriate book or two laying around the living room can be an effective nudge for the parent to read the book gift may entice caregivers to try shared book reading which may then lead to the development of a regular book reading routine especially when these incidental attempts are positive experiences for both the caregiver and the child the authors wrote harvard education professor james kim a reading specialist cautions against mailing out books without some sort of parent interaction i would say that the most cost effective and effective approach is not simply to give books to kids families but to ensure that there is some form of support via contacts tips on shared reading and providing ongoing nudges supports kim told me via email books are not a causal mechanism reading books and shared reading is the mechanism that leads to better skills books are just the resource that facilitates these literacy processes and yet the authors of the book giveaway meta analysis characterized the literacy benefits of simply giving away books as impressive they noted that in a meta analysis more expensive family programs that involved parent guidance and training had a smaller literacy benefit than what they calculated for book giveaways eliminating human intermediaries also keeps costs low dolly parton s book giveaway can cost as little as per child over five years the authors noted a doctor s or an educator s time is much more expensive given the cost effectiveness of the hands off approach the researchers suggest expanding book giveaways to more countries especially places like sub saharan africa and middle eastern refugee camps where many children don t have access to books as dolly parton herself once wrote true love so hard to find it knows no boundaries the same might be said for reading the hechinger report is a nonprofit independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education,pos

microsoft japan s experiment with day weekend boosts worker productivity by percent as it turns out not squeezing employees dry like a sponge is maybe a good thing japan has a reputation for not being so great when it comes to work life balance and it s a reputation that makes sense considering the country routinely scores toward the bottom when it comes to employee satisfaction around the developed world for decades this has been a known problem usually resulting in companies having after hours meetings to try and figure out how to reduce after hours meetings or just shrugging and declaring that it can t be helped but some businesses are finally taking actual steps to address the problem and one of them is probably the last company that many would expect microsoft japan a company that big might not seem like it would need to change anything since people will always want to work there so hearing they re trying changes is exciting last august microsoft japan carried out a working reform project called the work life choice challenge summer for one month last august the company implemented a three day weekend every week giving employees every friday off during the month this special paid vacation did not come at the expense of any other vacation time and the results were pretty incredible first off the reductions employees took percent fewer days off during the month printed percent fewer pages and used percent less electricity in the office since it was closed an extra day all of these saved the company quite a bit of money next the increases productivity went up by a staggering percent that means even though the employees were at work for less time more work was actually getting done a chart showing the changes the tweet reads it s been proven let s implement the three day weekend everywhere right now a lot of the increase in productivity is attributed to the changing of meetings with only four days to get everything done for the week many meetings were cut shortened or changed to virtual meetings instead of in person and even though it should seem obvious it s also important to note that percent of employees said that they liked the four day workweek at the end of the trial due to its success this year microsoft is planning on repeating it again next summer or perhaps at other times as well here s how japanese netizens reacted here s to hoping my boss reads about this so i guess me feeling like i m ready to be done for the week by wednesday is pretty natural unfortunately us japanese people value ignoring efficiency and wasting time at work over actually being productive i mean the people working at microsoft are first class employees i bet they could get everything done in three days i d love for this to be implemented more but i feel like making it work at companies open all week could be difficult they d have to hire more workers to rotate through the days yeah microsoft is different from regular businesses so i don t think this would work everywhere while some of the commentors have a point that this kind of policy wouldn t work for every type of job one thing is for certain humans are only capable of doing so much work in a week beyond a certain threshold no matter the job work isn t going to be work anymore it s just going to be time padding and considering that japan s overwork culture can be physically seen from the city streets taking a chance on something like this and seeing how it goes seems like a far better idea than just sticking with the status quo source nikkei business publications via my game news flash top image pakutaso insert image wikimedia commons odyssey want to hear about soranews s latest articles as soon as they re published follow us on facebook and twitter,pos

wildlife poachers in kenya to face death penalty this article has been updated see note below wildlife poachers in kenya will face the death penalty the country s tourism and wildlife minister has reportedly announced najib balala warned the tough new measure would be fast tracked into law existing deterrents against killing wild animals in the east african nation are insufficient mr balala said according to china s xinhua news agency so in an effort to conserve kenya s wildlife populations poachers will reportedly face capital punishment once the new law is passed kenya is home to a wide variety of treasured species in national parks and reserves including lions black rhinos ostriches hippos buffalos giraffe and zebra last year in the country elephants out of a population of and nine rhinos from a population of under were killed we have in place the wildlife conservation act that was enacted in and which fetches offenders a life sentence or a fine of us mr balala reportedly said however this has not been deterrence enough to curb poaching hence the proposed stiffer sentence the move could put kenya in conflict with the un which opposes the death penalty for all crimes worldwide un general assembly resolutions have called for a phasing out of capital punishment and the office of the high commissioner for human rights advocates its universal abolition kenya s tourism chiefs say poaching has been on a downward trend largely thanks to enhanced wildlife law enforcement efforts and investment in conservation these efforts led to an per cent reduction in rhino poaching and a per cent reduction in elephant poaching respectively in compared to when poaching was at its peak in and respectively the ministry said nevertheless earlier this month two black rhinos and a

still extremely high virtually cancelling out the overall population s growth rate according to the save the rhino organisation the charity points out many other african nations also suffer high rates of poaching the report of plans for capital punishment prompted sharply diverging reactions with some social media users applauding kenya and calling it fantastic news and others insisting it should never happen some said authorities should go after kingpin traffickers rather than the smallest animals in the criminal food chain for years many people angry at high levels of poaching linked with lucrative organised crime have called for the death sentence as a deterrent gangs sell elephant tusks for ivory in the far east where it is turned into trinkets rhino horn is believed by some wealthy buyers there to serve as a medicine even though it is made of keratin the same substance as human fingernails so has no health giving properties the convention on international trade in endangered

of kenya s ol pejeta conservancy that was home to sudan the world s last male northern rhino which was put down in march said the animal would be remembered for ever as a signal to the world while kenya was a global leader in conservation there are still many species across the planet that faced a similar plight he said update it has come to our attention through an afp article that the xinhua news agency was mistaken in its report last year that kenya s tourism and wildlife minister had announced plans to introduce the death penalty for wildlife poachers it appears the minister was not at the meeting on which xinhua reported and while a statement was read on his behalf by a colleague he has told afp that nothing i spoke on behalf of the minister was related to the death penalty for poachers he went on to say to afp that i think in that meeting one of the local leaders casually said that poachers should be killed but nothing official came from the ministry the independent has once again contacted the kenya wildlife service as well as the kenyan ministry of tourism and wildlife for further information,pos

l a county to stop collecting old juvenile detention fees erasing nearly million of families debt los angeles county supervisors voted tuesday to stop collecting fees once charged to families of juvenile delinquents for their incarceration ending a practice decried by criminal justice advocates as an unfair tax on minorities and an ineffective means of rehabilitating young people who commit crimes the motion sponsored by supervisors hilda solis and janice hahn directs the county s probation department to stop accepting payment and cancel nearly million in juvenile detention fees assessed before when the department suspended new fees but continued to collect payment of old ones the vote also follows a statewide ban which took effect jan on a range of court costs and fees charged to parents and guardians of children in the juvenile justice system almost every state in the country allows youth or their families to be charged for costs of the youths detention supervision or care while in custody according to an analysis by the juvenile law center a public interest law firm in philadelphia advertisement even after california s ban many counties are still collecting payment of previously assessed fees the state legislation helps youth and families who haven t yet experienced fines and fees but without this kind of move at the county level children and their families will still be struggling said jessica feierman associate director of the juvenile law center l a county s move comes amid a national shift in thinking about criminal justice with the rise of the black lives matter movement this is in the context of the post ferguson era where there s a lot more attention to fines and fees in the criminal justice system in general jeffrey selbin director of the policy advocacy clinic at uc berkeley school of law said in an interview ahead of the vote the clinic has extensively studied the use of juvenile fees in california supervisors said tuesday that collection of the fees no longer makes sense it is simply not worth the cost and effort to the county and more importantly not worth the cost to families to continue with these collection payments solis said before l a county s probation department regularly charged parents and guardians of juvenile delinquents fees for some of the costs associated with their child s detention at the time the fee was a day for juvenile halls and a day for probation camps collection efforts included intercepting state tax refunds putting liens on property and in some cases garnishing wages in in response to pressure from the youth justice coalition and a times investigation the probation department placed a moratorium on the fees though it continued to accept payments on pre bills advertisement those payments amounted to just in out of a total of million in outstanding debt across accounts according to the department research shows that juvenile detention fees impose financial hardships and strain on low income families and weigh disproportionately on black and latino youth who are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and are often sentenced to longer terms than white youth alberto penuelas who served time as a juvenile recalled the toll his detention fee took on his mother a single parent who worked in the fields they would call her every saturday collecting these debts she could barely afford to feed us he told the board i m hoping that this passes and this doesn t happen to other families advertisement research also suggests the fees may increase recidivism a study of more than youth in pennsylvania found that the total amount of fines fees and or restitution significantly increased the likelihood of recidivism within two years even after controlling for demographics and case characteristics the two main purposes of the juvenile justice system are to rehabilitate kids and to protect public safety and it turns out these fees undermine both of those said selbin of uc berkeley selbin said l a county s action tuesday is the largest discharge of such debt anywhere we hope this will be a signal to other counties he said advertisement nina agrawal latimes com twitter agrawalnina,pos
clallam bay inmates reunite with reformed dogs clallam bay wash ap prison inmates are teaching testy dogs civility at the clallam bay corrections center the dogs bounded into the visit room at the mixed custody prison for a reunion with their inmate handlers it was the first reunion in the five years that the sequim based welfare for animals guild has sponsored the dog training program which has given more than canines a new leash on life reported the peninsula daily news https bit ly dk kve there may be no better place for bite prone animals to receive the constant care they need to break out of their own prisons say inmates prison officials and wag organizers it s the perfect setting for dogs that need care to let go of their fear and anger guild president barbara brabant of sequim said the animals stay for weeks or months in the program however long it takes for them to become whole she said the men who train the animals learn responsibility acquire a skill they can use outside the prison walls and see their loving touch take hold said clallam bay resident tanja cain prison offender program coordinator and correctional unit supervisor michelle klepps who grew up in clallam bay and lives in forks this not only changes the dog it changes the offenders in a positive way klepps said brabant said the animals that lit up the visit room were among the adult dogs and puppies whose lives were turned around by the men who call the mixed custody facility home the inmates about a dozen among the at clallam bay have trained daily over weeks or months however long it takes until the dogs pass an american kennel club obedience test the akc will not certify inmates as dog trainers but wag is putting together a course under which they would be certified under wag s auspices upon leaving prison the animals sleep in the inmates cells and get taken on regular walks in a special prison yard where men hardened by circumstances and their own bad decisions dutifully scoop up their animals poop while in the training program the dogs are tethered by leashes colored red for don t touch the animal yellow for ask the handler first before petting and green for give the dog all the love you ve got participants at the reunion included a dozen inmates who earned participation in the program through good behavior about people attended including about wag board and group members and dog owners they were on the verge of giving up on their animals before the dogs adopted the inmates as their constant companions the dogs accompanied by their owners included sky the great pyrenees husky connor the boxer husky and skeeter the chihuahua skeeter was trained by seattle resident douglas gallagher serving life in prison as a three strike offender after gallagher whose third offense was robbery took in skeeter he watched the tiny pup go through two days of seizures before the dog lost its fear gallagher said in an interview before testimonials from inmates and dog owners watching this dog reminded me of how helpless my victims were said gallagher who has rehabilitated animals gallagher trained another animal who was afraid of that dog toy of all dog toys a frisbee being in a correctional facility is unlike anything in the world gallagher said this has helped a lot in dealing with people dealing with staff william friedrichs of olympia is serving years for armed robbery he said in an interview for him the dog training program is a path to a plateau he invoked more than once redemption i feel that through this program i am being able to top the scales by doing so much more good friedrichs said i m finally creating positive stuff instead of just negative destructive things it s helped with my ability to communicate with others and i ve become more compassionate friedrichs said there are not a lot of jobs in here that have that this is a very rewarding job in that sense most other prison jobs pay cents to cents an hour except for textiles related correctional industries where uniforms are made and inmates can earn up to an hour inmates in the dog training program are paid cents an hour but the wages are capped at a month for taking care of the dogs hours a day connor was an aggressive dog that friedrichs said he identified with and who brabant said was totally not adoptable it took friedrichs three to four months to train the pound animal not a bad dog just an aggressive dog friedrichs said he didn t want to fight but it turned into a fight because he didn t have a better way i spent a lot of time to socially interact and now he lives a full and happy life inmates can receive photos of the dogs they ve trained after they have been returned to their owners friedrichs has since seen photos of connor playing on a beach chasing birds but the pictures inmates receive lack people for safety reasons brabant said inmates don t know where the dogs live either that doesn t faze friedrichs who is proud when he sees dogs he has trained living happy lives you think yeah i did that he said during testimonials friedrichs sat next to connor s owner kathy schock of sequim after friedrichs tutelage connor was a totally different dog schock told the group that s all because of this guy here inmate charles graves who trained sky has been in the program longer than any other inmate the dogs have been abandoned just like a lot of other people he told the gathering the dogs have taught me how to rediscover bonding again i spend more time with these dogs than any person i have in my life graves recalled having a leashed dog at his side while talking to a friend over a prison phone graves had to tell the dog to stop annoying him his friend asked who he was talking to he said you got a dog they let you have dogs in prison he said what kind of prison you in inmate alan nord told the group that watching inmates and dogs interact has a positive effect on those observing their give and take to see the dudes in this prison that are killers and whatever they have a puppy you see the tension in the day room drop dramatically he said other state prisons also have dog training programs brabant said adding that clallam bay s is more rigorous than others cain said wag volunteers visit every week conduct training sessions and talk to the handlers prison superintendent ronald haynes said the program has a transformative impact on clallam bay s inmates it kind of takes them away from the prison life and gives them a purpose he said at the end of the presentation wag members inmates and dog owners were urged to mingle with a reminder that the setting for all this good cheer was a prison no hugging just handshakes brabant told the gathering after the event the inmates dressed in neat khaki pants and white t shirts returned to their daily lives while visitors waited for the locked visit room door to open so they could collect keys and wallets secured in the waiting area near the entrance door the walkway outside led to an exit gate past stacked tubular bales of razor wire several feet away and a closer row of small signs that warned any inmates who could read the signs that if they strayed lethal force awaited them brabant said wag and center valley animal rescue in quilcene are starting a training program for cats that need to be socialized that s modeled after the one for dogs she said three felines are already being leash and clicker trained at clallam bay by inmates in the prison s restrictive closed custody unit there s cat guys out there brabant joked information from

want to quit your job and start a true crime podcast obscura s host did it valrico it was a monday afternoon in the tampa suburbs all cul de sacs and overturned tricycles baking in the sun in the two car garage of the three bedroom house with the tree swing there was talk of murder justin drown host of obscura a true crime podcast keeps it cold as a morgue in there the garage is a converted family room with a couch a tv and scattered kids toys it s where drown records and edits each episode of his show looking back at an often grisly real life crime drown has recounted infamous cases such as the murder of ennis cosby and gary ridgeway the green river killer but focuses mostly on the obscure a recent episode told the tale of gertrude baniszewski the skeleton lady who took in a teenager in s indianapolis before enlisting her own children and some neighborhood kids in the girl s torture sitting on drown s desk was a microphone and an autopsy report for iana kasian a lawyer and model scalped by her graphic novelist fiance episode the west hollywood vampire there was a book titled profitable podcasting and stickers featuring obscura s logo a yawning skull with crime scene tape threaded through its teeth drown sends the stickers and occasionally one of those autopsy reports as thank you gifts to the more than fans signed up to donate a month via patreon a crowd funding site whatever drown is doing seems to be working obscura had downloads in the final week of may and a year in his audience keeps growing the podcast earns him around to a month partly from donations but mostly from traditional advertising if things continue to snowball drown could have a bona fide hit on his hands a year ago he was a dropout from nursing school creatively unfulfilled working as an overnight security guard at port tampa bay he d sit alone in the dark guarding some desolate warehouse where nobody ever came but they were required to have a security guard there because it was in some contract or something he listened to true crime podcasts to pass the time now his email in box is so flooded with messages from fans that he can t respond to them all and the side effects of constantly being exposed to depravity the freedom and creativity outweigh that stuff at least for now despite his grave vocal delivery on the show and a promotional photo in which his face is hidden in shadows drown does not seem to be a dark soul maybe just a little serious in person he comes off as a warmhearted thoughtful homebody who gets joy from hanging out with his family including a stepdaughter and year old step grandson who live with them he is fond of labeling himself with the hashtag younggrandpa he listens to jazz while he works he watches live video games and movies with his wife rebecca but not too many horror flicks he consumes no true crime when he s not working but work is always waiting obscura is part of a vast and fast growing constellation of true crime audio ranging from prestige journalism by some of the nation s top news organizations to homegrown fare from amateurs taking advantage of podcasting s low barriers to entry for every slickly produced serial or dirty john or peabody award winning in the dark there are indie shows created by bedroom upstarts like drown with zero journalism or broadcast experience among them are shows such as killafornia dreaming murderous minors criminology and southern fried true crime started by a preschool teacher a baker a salesman and an accountant respectively jami rice who worked in commercial real estate started murderish as a way to share her experience as a juror stephen pacheco left a job in logistics for a large retail chain a year and a half after launching trace evidence the host of swindled known only as a concerned citizen was searching for a particular type of true crime show realizing he could make it himself he eventually left a cushy government job as a financial analyst with benefits for a significant and mostly fan supported podcast income the indie hosts share a community gathering online and at events such as the true crime podcast festival in chicago and in many cases share an audience many recall a childhood spent watching unsolved mysteries and forensic files or perusing used bookstores for true crime paperbacks all say their shows with weekly downloads numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands make money most have been able to leave their day jobs becoming rich is suddenly a real possibility indianapolis crime stoppers volunteer ashley flowers started recording crime junkie in her home office with a childhood friend producing and her brother editing it recently jumped into the top podcasts on itunes and now gets more than million downloads a month it could generate millions of dollars it s tough to say how many of the hundreds of thousands of active podcasts in existence are devoted to true crime but it s definitely an outsized amount said nicholas quah who writes about the podcast industry for new york magazine and his newsletter hot pod he calls true crime the bloody beating heart of podcasting this week for example of the top shows on apple s podcasts app are true crime including man in the window crime junkie the shrink next door monster presents insomniac and my favorite murder there are many theories on why people like true crime which is most popular with women drown said more than percent of his listeners are women perhaps it s because women are much more likely to be the victim of crime perpetrated by an intimate partner a common theme in true crime shows perhaps it allows people to experience powerful emotions of fear and horror in a controlled environment perhaps listening releases adrenaline and it becomes addictive perhaps it s natural human fascination with taboo subjects perhaps we can t look away because we evolved to pay attention to what might harm us perhaps it provides a sense of control in a chaotic world perhaps it s a comfort for people who have survived abuse or violence a way of feeling heard a lot of fans are people with a history of abuse drown said i ve had people reach out and say listening makes them feel better like a coping mechanism i had a lot of abuse growing up that s probably why i m interested in it that abuse he said came at the hands of a family member who heard voices that said young drown was the antichrist which led to beatings and sexual molestation some people they see true crime and they would think like why would anybody be into that he said but surprisingly for some of us that are into it it s a comfort you know it s you re not going through this life alone kind of thing the genre has always been extremely popular in all forms of media from sober news reporting to sensational tabloids to big budget docuseries on hbo and netflix the anyone can do it nature of podcasting quah said has been the big difference often it is those shaggy indie types that garner highly engaged fan communities there s a real conspiratorial power that podcasts can bring when it s a guy in their basement it feels like a very intimate form of the internet but they can be problematic while there are many thoroughly reported ethically minded investigations such as in the dark there are also these smaller shops where amateurs and hobbyists come in quah points to the extremely popular up and vanished which started as an investigation of a year old cold case of a missing georgia beauty queen and ended with two arrests last year it was created by an aspiring documentarian and he arguably accidentally helped solve that case but in doing so he handled facts in ways that are slightly unethical or dubious at best drown mostly stays away from unsolved mysteries due to such complications early on he did an episode about a california desert city where people go missing i have a pretty good feeling for who did it he said but i can t say he also has strong feelings about the type of people who should be making true crime content he has sparred publicly and privately with south florida s mike boudet the controversial former host of the hit series sword and scale which has a similar format to obscura drown was a fan who was inspired by sword and scale and even moderated the show s reddit page at one time now he says he recognizes the nuance and certain level of decorum and empathy a person should have if they re going to cover such sensitive topics prominent podcast company wondery cut ties with sword and scale recently a day after boudet was called out for posting a misogynistic and violent joke on international women s day some fans of obscura have pointed to the show as the antidote for sword and scale listeners seeking an alternative debates over true crime usually come back to this core question is it okay to be entertained by the worst thing that ever happened to someone in an essay for vulture that doesn t answer that question definitively writer alice bolin said that in the end she prefers obviously lowbrow fare like dateline and the investigation discovery network over prestige true crime like serial and making a murderer while both can cause harm prestige true crime is less enjoyable she wrote and in its dignified guise has maybe only perfected a method of making us feel less gross about consuming real people s pain for fun drown doesn t skimp on graphic details culled from interviews court documents and archive audio episode about a young man who detailed his dark fetishes in horribly candid online videos is literally gag inducing audio from those videos is part of the episode people thought the man s stories were just attention grabbing exaggerations then the man was convicted of molesting his stepsister and sentenced to years drown has his own code of ethics he finds a lot of true crime stuff too sensational in the garage he played a clip of dr phil interviewing a murderer about what sound a hammer made on a skull as an example but what he dislikes even more is when criminals are made more palatable for entertainment sometimes to the point where they look cool so many podcasts and tv shows are made in awe of these killers he said so many movies are made that reduce what these people did probably the most accurate serial killer movie i ve ever seen is henry portrait of a serial killer but even then they just took the edge off the blade by the end you almost feel sympathetic for him unintentionally a lot of people have created antiheroes out of some of these serial killers over time you know charles manson ted bundy they sell them on shirts and shot glasses which grosses me out and that s because people don t really understand what s happening in these cases and so i actually think those details are important he said he takes care to tell the victims stories to celebrate obscura s one year anniversary episode was a remake of episode about mona biddy a disabled child found dead in a jackson miss reservoir in the early s and the case against her stepmother the original didn t honor the memory of the victim in the end he said he just wants to expose terrible realities that exist fans who donate get special access to obscura s black label content which drown feels the need make without the help of the freelance writers or researchers who work on obscura those are the episodes so dark he s afraid to ask anyone else to work on them or even upload them to itunes where people might stumble on them for free i m really not a fan of creating them i actually spend a lot of time telling people not to listen to those drown said but i think i ve covered some really important subjects nobody is talking about he has done black label episodes on rape on porn sets and the industry around fetish videos that involve extreme animal cruelty drown a man who spent most of the year immersed in the worst side of humanity said it has been the best year of his life since he was a teenager but he sometimes feels the effects i m fine though he said if or when i feel like i can t handle it anymore then i ll take a break he has has occasionally had

conversion therapy what you need to know in an about face the federal government is considering a change to the criminal code to ban the practice of conversion therapy across the country in march this year the liberal government rejected a petition with more than signatures calling for a national ban it said that conversion therapies are immoral painful and do not reflect the values of our government or those of canadians but added that it felt conversion therapy was largely a provincial and territorial issue however according to a letter signed by two liberal cabinet ministers and an alberta mp and sent to the provinces in june the federal government is now looking at ways to reform the criminal code in order to combat conversion therapy news of the possible national ban comes as st albert alta has become the second canadian city after vancouver to make it illegal for businesses to offer conversion therapy other regions are also considering whether to follow suit watch the national s story about st albert s conversion therapy ban alberta city moves to ban anti gay conversion therapy the national alberta s united conservative government says it does not condone conversion therapy in fact only a handful of provinces have banned it outright but the frustration that alberta hasn t done so has prompted one alberta city to take its own stand what is it conversion therapy is a practice that aims to change an individual s sexual orientation to heterosexual or gender identity to cisgender which means identifying with the sex assigned to them at birth it employs various approaches from talk therapy and medication to aversion therapy that attempts to condition a person s behaviour by causing them discomfort through things like electric shocks when they re exposed to specific stimuli it is believed conversion therapy has existed for more than a century with german psychiatrist albert von schrenck notzing being one of the first to use the practice on patients peter gajdics author of the book the inheritance of shame spent six years in conversion therapy with a licensed psychiatrist in victoria b c at first he says the psychiatrist prescribed several antidepressants and a sedative so that gajdics innate heterosexuality would resurface when that didn t happen gajdics says his psychiatrist began using aversion therapy it s not so much that i

research chair for the public understanding of sexual gender minority youth and describes the dangers of the controversial therapy where is conversion therapy offered in canada these days it s uncommon to find medical professionals offering conversion therapy to patients you won t be able to walk into a licensed counsellor s office and ask them to engage in this practice because it would be deemed to be unethical and unprofessional says dr kristopher wells canada research chair for the public understanding of sexual and gender minority youth as a result wells warns the practice has gone underground in faith based communities which makes it harder to detect but also more dangerous watch the national s video of matt ashcroft and peter gajdics talking about the toll conversion therapy took on them the painful toll of going through conversion therapy the national those who ve experienced conversion therapy often describe it as difficult and painful the national reached out to two canadians who have gone through it and they agreed to share their stories does conversion therapy work the science says no researchers at cornell university looked at peer reviewed studies from through about the effects of conversion therapy they found only studies made an empirical determination about whether conversion therapy works of the studies concluded conversion therapy is ineffective and or harmful the lone study that suggested conversion therapy could be successful had notable limitations as it was entirely based on self reporting according to researchers conversion therapy can lead to depression self loathing self harming behaviours such as cutting or drug and alcohol abuse all the way up to people taking their own lives wells says the world health organization issued a statement in saying this type of therapy poses a severe threat to the health and human rights of the affected persons the canadian psychological association which represents psychologists warned in a statement that conversion or reparative therapy can result in negative outcomes such as distress anxiety depression negative self image a feeling of personal failure difficulty sustaining relationships and sexual dysfunction the cpa added that it opposes any therapy with the goal of repairing or converting an individual s sexual orientation regardless of age including conversion therapy what are governments doing about it the provincial territorial municipal and federal governments all have roles to play to protect canadians from the harms associated with the practice reads a

why forests are spreading in the rich world forests in countries like brazil and congo get a lot of attention from conservationists and it is easy to see why south america and sub saharan africa are experiencing deforestation on an enormous scale every year almost m hectares are lost net but forests are also changing in rich western countries they are growing larger both in the sense that they occupy more land and that the trees in them are bigger what is going on forests are spreading in almost all western countries with the fastest growth in places that historically had rather few trees in of spain was forested now the proportion is in both greece and italy the growth was from to over the same period forests are gradually taking more land in america and australia perhaps most astonishing is the trend in ireland roughly of that country was forested when it became independent in now forests cover of the land and the government wants to push the proportion to by the s two things are fertilising this growth the first is the abandonment of farmland especially in high parched places where nothing grows terribly well when farmers give up trying to eke out a living from olives or sheep trees simply move in the second is government policy and subsidy governments have protected and promoted forests for diverse reasons ranging from the need for wooden warships to a desire to promote suburban house building increasingly they welcome forests because they are carbon sinks the justifications change the desire for more trees remains constant the greening of the west does not delight everyone farmers complain that land is being taken out of use by generously subsidised tree plantations they get subsidies too but the ones for tree planting are especially generous parts of spain and portugal are afflicted by terrible forest fires these burn especially hot in areas with lots of eucalyptus trees an australian import that was planted for its pulp but has spread of its own accord others simply dislike the appearance of conifer forests planted in neat rows they will have to get used to the trees however the growth of western forests seems almost as inexorable as deforestation elsewhere,pos
for north korean soldier s recovery south koreans are pinning their hopes on this doctor no medical drama is complete without a bold yet sensitive heartthrob doctor in a leading role the incredible tale of a north korean soldier s escape across the demilitarized zone last week is no exception the mcdreamy in this case is lee cook jong the trauma surgeon who has operated on the soldier several times and provided updates along the way including a video showing lee picking inch long parasitic worms out of the man s intestines and his declaration wednesday that the defector will survive the patient is not going to die lee told reporters at ajou university hospital south of seoul announcing that the man had regained consciousness and was stable although he remains in the intensive care unit he could be transferred to a general ward as soon as this weekend the year old north korean soldier who has been identified only by his surname oh was shot five times as he made his brazen escape nov closed circuit television footage released by the u s military on wednesday showed oh driving a jeep southward before the vehicle became stuck in a ditch yards from the military demarcation line that forms the border oh jumped out and started running for the line four north korean border guards tried to stop him firing more than rounds at him one guard briefly crossed the line violating the armistice that ended the korean war in the video showed oh lying wounded in a pile of leaves against a building on the southern side then three south korean soldiers crawled out and dragged him to safety from there he was put in a u s army black hawk helicopter and flown miles south to the hospital in suwon where lee was waiting if it weren t for their emergency measures he would have died before arriving at the hospital lee said dramatic video shows north korean soldier making a run for freedom it was still touch and go when oh arrived at the hospital his blood pressure was so low after losing so much blood that the doctors did not even have time to check his blood type instead they pumped about units between three and four times the amount of blood contained in a human body of type o into him he has had three surgeries including an attempt to repair his damaged internal organs and stop the contamination caused by the parasites and the injuries through it all the trauma surgeon often in scrubs has been giving regular updates on the soldier s condition the revelation that the man had a severe parasitic infection lee said he had never seen such a case except in medical textbooks and that his stomach contained raw corn kernels prompted widespread shock in south korea north korean front line soldiers were supposed to be elite troops yet this man had worms not seen in south korea since the s and had been eating uncooked corn oh also has tuberculosis and hepatitis b lee said and at feet inches tall and weighing about pounds he is several inches shorter and pounds lighter than the average male year old south korean there is intense interest in the soldier and military intelligence officers reportedly are eager to question him about his escape but lee has been fending them off the soldier is showing signs of depression and post traumatic stress and it will take about a month before he is well enough to answer questions the doctor said for now lee is keeping the conversation light talking about the way things are done in south korea rather than asking him about north korea and trying to cheer him up the medical staff played him gee a peppy pop song by girls generation featuring lyrics such as oh it s too pretty your soul s too pretty it s love at first sight and he declared that he liked girl bands lee also said oh has been watching the american tv series csi and the action movie the transporter in which a former special forces operative hires himself out as a mercenary the staff also has hung a south korean flag in his room to reassure him he really is in the south escaped north korean soldier fights for life after being shot crossing dmz this is not lee s first time in the spotlight the surgeon became a national hero in when he saved the life of a ship captain who had been shot by somali pirates after pirates seized a chemical freighter near the gulf of aden in south korean commandos stormed the ship and the pirates shot the captain six times during the rescue attempt lee was waiting at a hospital in oman and saved the captain s life earning a reputation as the country s leading trauma surgeon there was even a popular medical drama based on this story golden time the title was a reference to lee s frequent reminder that it is the hour after a severe injury that is most important for saving someone s life the year old lee who is blind in one eye and renowned for working hour shifts was also the inspiration for a character in another drama romantic doctor teacher kim released last year he became such a celebrity that even octogenarians with diabetes were trying to get in to see him lee became a doctor in south korea but trained as a critical care surgeon at the university of california at san diego medical center in he then went on to the royal london hospital s trauma center returning home he realized that there was no equivalent facility at any hospital in south korea and estimated that about trauma patients were dying in the country each year because of treatment delays and a lack of dedicated trauma units he persuaded authorities to fund proper trauma centers including his unit at ajou university hospital now percent of revenue from traffic fines goes to trauma centers in the country american detained trying to enter north korea north korean soldier escapes to the south but for a trauma surgeon lee faces a predicament that is unimaginable for american er doctors he seldom gets to treat gunshot wounds because south korea has very strict rules on gun ownership ten murders with a firearm were reported in south korea between and compared with in the united states according to figures from the small arms survey instead the relatively few gunshot wounds he has treated have been sustained by south korean and u s soldiers hurt during military drills he told the korea times in still that appears to have been enough practice to save the north korean soldier s life now south

france wants to ban sale of gas and diesel cars by end coal by in an address on thursday france s environment minister nicolas hulot said that the country would aim to phase out electricity from coal fired plants by and end the sale of gas and diesel internal combustion cars by this first goal should be relatively easy to attain france relies heavily on nuclear energy more than percent of the country s energy mix is nuclear and coal fired plants only contribute to around four percent of france s electric production hulot also said that he hoped to reduce the amount of nuclear energy in the country s energy mix down to percent by although according to le monde the environment minister admitted he does not have all the answers in addition hulot noted a law would be proposed later this year to potentially end any new operating licenses for oil gas and coal mining the automotive goal is more of a stretch although details on how the french government would do this are scarce le monde reports that part of the plan will involve offering money to qualifying households to replace their pre gasoline or pre diesel cars advertisement hulot called the end of the sale of gas and diesel cars a public health agenda and mentioned volvo s recent commitment to only sell electric or hybrid vehicles by engadget notes that the french government owns a considerable stake in psa owner of peugeot and citroen as well as renault regulators could potentially affect auto manufacturer operations through internal pressure hulot didn t say whether plug in hybrid electric vehicles would be factored into the ban or not the minister admitted that achieving the goal would likely burden automakers recent numbers from germany reflect how daunting moving a country s transportation sector away from fossil fuels can be and an international energy agency report from june noted that without government incentives getting people to buy electric vehicles is especially challenging on the other hand a report from bloomberg energy finance released this week suggests that electric vehicles will outsell internal combustion vehicles in years due to falling battery prices the bloomberg new energy finance forecast says adoption of emission free vehicles will happen more quickly than previously estimated because the cost of building cars is falling so fast bloomberg wrote the seismic shift will see cars with a plug account for a third of the global auto fleet by and displace about eight million barrels a day of oil production more than the seven million barrels saudi arabia exports today,pos

academic writes wikipedia pages in a year to get female scientists noticed jess wade is a scientist on a mission she wants every woman who has achieved something impressive in science to get the prominence and recognition they deserve starting with a wikipedia entry i ve done about in the past year says wade a postdoctoral researcher in the field of plastic electronics at imperial college london s blackett laboratory i had a target for doing one a day but sometimes i get too excited and do three that science doesn t attract enough girls and has ground to make up in supporting and celebrating its women can feel like a tired refrain in academia but wade s approach is refreshing and infectious i kind of realised we can only really change things from the inside she says wikipedia is a really great way to engage people in this mission because the more you read about these sensational women the more you get so motivated and inspired by their personal stories ever since darwin s time women have been fighting back i suddenly realised i can do this i can change it wade went to an all girls school and with both her parents being doctors science was a backdrop to her childhood she does not recall encountering barriers on her way to gaining a place to study physics as an undergraduate at imperial when she started the course was so tough and she was so focused on doing well it barely registered that there weren t many girls around it was only as a phd student that she was struck by how being in a minority can shape day to day experiences being isolated is hard this goes for all underrepresented groups she says then there are all those challenges during your phd that amplify that isolation if you don t have anyone you can really get on with around you it s so so hard wade started giving talks at schools and became engaged in outreach to encourage girls to take up science but quickly became frustrated with much of the work going on under the women in science banner the projected messages often felt fundamentally negative such as the is not enough tagline of a campaign by the institution of engineering and technology if i heard something was only of girls when i was at school i would ve been like no says wade worse still was the european commission s bungled attempt to give science a sexy feminine makeover in its science it s a girl thing video in which three young women prance around on a catwalk while decoding the chemical composition of lipsticks and nail varnish it infuriates me that even for a blink of an eyelid they think that kind of thing will change anything wade tells me through gritted teeth many of the initiatives are backed by a significant amount of funding wade estimates m to m is spent annually on women in science outreach with big contributions from banks and engineering firms as well as the government it s not just a few academics going out and doing talks in schools it s huge investments of money she says yet there appeared to be little or no evaluation as to whether the projects had achieved their aims and the evidence was not encouraging in the uk the percentage of female a level physics students has stagnated at about for the past decade and for computing the proportion of a level students who are female is just in britain fewer than of professional engineers are women a figure that is among the worst globally and which has not increased in the past decade a recent study suggests it would take years to close the gender gap in physics based on current rates of progress there s so much energy enthusiasm and money going into all these initiatives to get girls into science she says absolutely none of them is evidence based and none of them work it s so unscientific that s what really surprises me wade began to look into what had been shown to work best speaking to parents and teachers for instance rather than just focusing solely on pupils after seeing the reach achieved by uploading scientific images on to wikimedia commons the free photo sharing site she decided to do the same for scientists themselves professor kim cobb a us climate scientist was her first subject she s super interesting she does really cool research on corals and she goes diving to collect samples she says soon after wade went to a talk by susan goldberg editor of national geographic the first woman to hold this post who noticed she too lacked a wikipedia entry i thought that s outrageous so i did her page she says since then she has done hundreds more as we weave our way through a labyrinthine intersection between imperial s physics and maths buildings wade greets a colleague before turning to me to say that s emma mccoy the first woman to be a professor of maths here i made her page there are inevitable critics of the project last week she received a message on twitter from an oxford phd student accusing her of using wikipedia to self promote and publicise friends this is not what wikipedia is about he wrote think about the damage you re causing to the wiki community she says she knew he was wrong but still had a wobble however she was met with a surge of online support and wade s subjects none of whom she had met personally before writing their entry have been almost universally thrilled professors feel really empowered when they ve got one she says wade s activism is not limited to online after reading angela saini s book inferior which applies scientific scrutiny to claims of sex differences and gender stereotypes wade started distributing copies i realised that this kind of bias has been penetrating through society for so long she says ever since darwin s time women have been fighting back i suddenly realised i can do this i can change it and i can make sure other people read this too she estimates she has bought and handed out or copies of the book to friends family and fellow scientists at international conferences about a week ago angela said you ve got to stop buying them and sent me signed copies she says before insisting i leave with a copy she relentlessly nominates other women for prizes including emma chapman an astrophysicist at imperial who was awarded the royal society s athena prize last week and when i meet her she is surrounded by a huddle of girls on work experience who are shadowing her that day what does she ultimately hope to achieve i guess it s to make science a better place for everyone working in it which happens when we recognise the contributions of these awesome women she says then the girls who do come because they will will come to a much more empowering environment,pos

wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the word canada waved to reporters as she walked through toronto s pearson international airport she was accompanied by foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland who said al qunun will be going to her unspecified new home she is obviously very tired after a long journey and she preferred to go and get settled freeland said of al qunun who declined to speak to reporters al qunun did however take some time to pose for photographs with freeland she wanted canadians to see that she s here that she s well and that she is very very happy to be in her new home freeland explained saudi teenager rahaf mohammed al qunun arrived at toronto pearson international airport on saturday morning chris young canadian press social media campaign to saverahaf the young woman fled her family while visiting kuwait and flew to bangkok where she barricaded herself in an airport hotel and launched a twitter campaign that drew global attention to her case al qunun says her father physically abused her and tried to force her into an arranged marriage her father who arrived in bangkok not long before she left has denied those allegations i m the girl who ran away to thailand i m now in real danger because the saudi embassy is trying to force me to return said an english translation of one of her first posts to twitter the teen also wrote that she was afraid and

asked canada to take al qunun as a refugee and canada agreed that is something that we are pleased to do because canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights to stand up for women s rights around the world trudeau said unhcr spokeswoman lauren la rose praised canada s willingness to step up and assist in this case but noted that al qunun s situation highlights a need for more interventions around the world canada has been a great ally and leader in this area but there needs to be more spaces so that women and girls or anyone that is vulnerable can find a safe third country to resettle in la rose said starting a life in canada costi a toronto based non profit that helps newly arrived immigrants and refugees will assist al qunun as she adjusts to a new life as a government sponsored refugee she will have access to government assistance for up to months this is a young woman who is determined to make a future said mario calla executive director of costi it s not going to be all smooth sailing for her when one considers the fact that she has had to leave her family to leave a familiar culture and social connections it s not going to be an easy process for her he added according to calla al qunun has some contacts in the city and has reached out to them on saturday afternoon she went shopping to buy winter clothes a single woman to be in a dangerous situation is one too many news foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland says canada believes very strongly that women s rights are human rights in the coming days representatives from costi will help her open a bank account apply for a social insurance number and obtain a health card calla explained then they will try to find her permanent housing calla said he s not sure if she intends to stay in toronto in the long term for now al qunun is staying at a facility that has security guards present at all times we have advised her to be careful about disclosing her location she s taken a position in terms of leaving saudi arabia where some may disagree with her and may have strong opinions about that we re being careful to protect her from that calla said he added that there may be an increase in asylum seekers using social media as a tool to reach out to governments and agencies to make their case for being granted asylum there are many many people in desperate situations desperate in the sense that their lives are in danger they will do anything to get out of those situations to safety so it may be a tool that some will use he said tensions with saudi arabia the move to accept al qunun could serve to heighten tensions between canada and saudi arabia in august saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman expelled canada s ambassador and withdrew his own envoy after freeland used twitter to call for the release of women s rights activists who had been arrested in the country the saudis also sold canadian investments and recalled their students from universities in canada but trudeau appeared unfazed by the possibility that the move could have ill effects repeating that canada stands up for human rights regardless of diplomatic consequences freeland echoed that sentiment in comments to reporters saturday it is absolutely the case that there are many women far far too many women who are in dangerous situations both in canada and around the world she said but rather than cursing the darkness i believe in lighting a single candle and where we can save a single person where we can save a single woman that is a good thing to do a dangerous precedent however one former diplomat questioned the canadian government s actions in this instance saying it sets a very dangerous precedent for future cases david chatterson served as canada s ambassador to saudi arabia from to what happens the next time a teenage girl or adult woman from saudi arabia that flees her family and declares herself to no longer be a muslim does that mean automatic sanctuary one would almost conclude so from the actions taken in this case he said in an interview with cbc news network he added that the normal process of assessing a refugee claim

iowa woman who fostered more than children says she loved them like they were my own cnn linda herring always wanted a big family but she never imagined that she would foster more than children and turn her home into a safe haven where every child was given shelter food clothing and most importantly endless amounts of love now years old herring has been fostering children for nearly five decades in johnson county iowa herring and her husband bob began fostering when they lived in oxford iowa and continued to do so after they moved to tiffin my best friend was doing foster care for teenage girls and i thought well that would be nice to do the same but i wanted little kids herring told cnn so i talked to the department of human services and agreed to take kids with medical needs as a foster mom herring ran a home daycare for local families and worked as a night custodian in a nearby high school if that wasn t enough she also volunteered as a first responder for nearly years herring was known by everyone in johnson county for never turning away a child no matter their age gender or special needs and would regularly travel to pick up foster children who needed a home fostering turned into adopting herring is not just a foster mom for her eight children three of which were foster children she and bob adopted she was just mom one of those children is year old anthony herring he was months old when he was placed in the herring household when he was years old the herring family officially adopted him i appreciate being adopted even more today as a parent then i did when i was a child anthony herring told cnn i m forever grateful for the life i was given she and dad have both taught me that family isn t determined by blood it s who you have in your life to love he said that his mom taught him how to appreciate and understand children with special needs linda herring holds the resolution from the johnson county board of supervisors honoring her for fostering more than children two of herring s adopted foster children have severe medical and special needs one of them dani is fully dependent on others for care while dani wasn t expected to live long after her birth she is now years old herring passed on what she likes to call her foster care trait four of her biological children have fostered children and three of them followed their parents footsteps and adopted kids of their own three of her grandchildren fostered children as well it s hard to say in words her impact she was always available and ready for a child in need these kids were usually taken from a traumatic situation and she d take them in provide a warm bed clean clothes warm meals and love anthony said she also worked hard to keep families together keeping siblings together helping biological parents make the changes needed to be able to keep their children she always makes sure a new child in her home was given a professional photograph that was placed on the wall in the living room that seems like a small thing but it helps them feel like they re at home everything comes from love when it comes to herring s inspiration to foster children she had one explanation love i would just love my foster kids just like they were my own probably more than i should herring said i cried when the kids would leave my home no matter how long they had been there it was so hard for me to say goodbye to them i always questioned why do i keep doing this because it was never easy to say goodbye to a child but i kept doing it because i had so much love to give to these children in need herring carries with her memories of each child that she has protected and loved once she said she was called in by dhs in the middle of the night to pick up three young children who had been abandoned another memory is the look on the face of a young girl she fostered when she saw her brand new clothes the first new clothes the little girl said she was ever given while herring s time as a foster parent is over she enjoys the photos and cards she receives from the children she fostered after they ve been adopted her favorite part is when her foster children come back to visit after they ve grown up herring s impact as a foster mom went beyond the children she took in tonya stratton whose mother was one of herring s foster children grew up calling herring grama linda and spending her childhood making friends with herring s foster kids grama linda it s now your time to relax but first you must learn the definition of that and then learn to sit without rocking learn to appreciate quiet no more piles and piles of laundry to fold groceries to buy diapers to change stratton said in a facebook tribute to herring it s your time now to rest go through your memories put your feet up or take a nap and try to understand how incredibly worthy you are to do whatever the hell you want she would meet anywhere to get a child in october herring chose to stop fostering children due to health concerns her granddaughter amber herring told cnn after announcing her decision to stop herring was honored by the johnson county board of supervisors with a resolution of appreciation on thursday the board of supervisors department of human services and a standing room only crowd recognized linda faye herring last night for nearly five decades of serving as a foster parent to more than children in johnsoncountyia pic twitter com wgv jqebmj johnson county iowa johnsoncountyia january the department of human services would call linda in the middle of the night to take a child and she would meet anywhere to get a child the resolution said in recognition of herring s efforts linda mostly fostered young children with special medical needs and kept bins of clothes in her garage stacked to the ceiling labeled by size and gender no one had to worry about a child going without clothes at linda s even if they arrived with nothing but what they re

republic of congo names new national park home to gorillas elephants the new ogoou leketi national park is the republic of congo s fifth national park it borders bat k plateau national park in neighboring gabon and together the two parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than square kilometers square miles the official designation of ogoou leketi national park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down all of the rights holding communities that live close to the ogoou leketi national park were involved in the process of creating the protected area according to the wildlife conservation society s congo program the republic of congo has officially created its fifth national park lending protection to great apes forest elephants and other threatened wildlife the new ogoou leketi national park spans square kilometers square miles and borders bat k plateau national park in neighboring gabon together the two national parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than square kilometers square miles ogoou leketi is also part of the bat k plateau landscape a unique patchwork of large rolling savannas on sandy hills interrupted by long strips of dense forests and turquoise blue river valleys this savanna forest complex is home to several threatened species some found nowhere else in congo according to a press release from the wildlife conservation society s congo program which has been surveying the area with the country s ministry of forestry economy since in the iucn identified the region in which the park sits today as a priority conservation site for the protection of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla gorilla gorilla gorilla and the endangered central chimpanzee pan troglodytes troglodytes said mark gately country director for wcs congo the forest sector of the new park is also home to several other species such as the african forest elephant loxodonta cyclotis forest buffalo syncerus caffer nanus red river hog potamochoerus porcus and several species of monkey including the iconic mandrill mandrillus sphinx the savanna part of the national park too hosts a wide range of wildlife the park has at least six species of rare savanna plants that are specialists of the kalahari sands the substrate that forms the bat k plateau and other savanna specialists like the bush duiker sylvicapra grimmia side striped jackal canis adustus and several species of birds the national park area was in fact identified by birdlife international as a site of high importance for bird conservation in the official designation of ogoou leketi national park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down logging activity had expanded into the proposed protected area since gately said with loggers searching mainly for okoum trees aucoumea klaineana for use in plywood all three logging companies which are still active around the periphery of the park completed logging within parts of the concessions overlapping the park in december with the support of the congolese minister of forestry economy mrs rosalie matondo the creation of the park has eliminated logging activity within the protected area boundaries securing the closed canopy forest habitat that covers roughly a third of the park gately said the roads and bridges that the logging companies built into the proposed park area have however facilitated commercial bushmeat hunting such hunting is currently the biggest threat to the area s wildlife and this trade links to cities like pointe noire and brazzaville but also across the border towards gabon gately said great ape numbers have declined significantly in the area since and elephants even if their population seems stable recently started changing their behaviour visiting forest clearings more at night than during the day behaviour that is generally observed in elephant populations that perceive threats from humans in their habitat gately added with the logging companies out the government and wcs congo are now working with local communities to draw up a management plan for the national park while no villages existed inside the area now designated as ogoou leketi national park there are five villages very close to the park boundary the residents of these villages have traditionally used the national park area for their needs and continue to depend on the forest for their sustenance all of the rights holding communities living near the national park were involved in the process of creating the protected area since the project was launched gately said the boundaries of the protected area were mapped to ensure the villages weren t incorporated into the national park the communities also helped identify and map areas of cultural and traditional importance to them the participatory mapping process led the government to highlight any cultural or natural resource use zones that overlap with critical high ecological value areas including bais swampy mineral rich meadows that will be integrated into the park under eco development zones gately said in these identified areas which will be integrated into the management plan of the park rights holding communities will be able to continue traditional and subsistence based gathering fishing or hunting the maps including the limit of the future park and the eco development zones were validated for each village in order to ensure full consent banner

man invents electric car battery that lasts miles when charged imagine the satisfaction of driving your environmentally friendly electric car for miles without having to stop to recharge the battery a distance more than four times as far as the best and most expensive model currently on the road under the bonnet is a revolutionary new type of battery which unlike those used in conventional electric cars can also power buses huge lorries and even aircraft what s more it s far simpler and cheaper to make than the batteries currently in use in millions of electric vehicles around the world and unlike them it can easily be recycled this might sound like a science fiction fantasy but it s not last friday the battery s inventor british engineer and former royal navy officer trevor jackson signed a multi million pound deal to start manufacturing the device on a large scale in the uk the father of eight battery inventor engineer trevor jackson from tavistock devon who has signed a multi million pound deal to start manufacturing the device on a large scale in the uk austin electric an engineering firm based in essex which now owns the rights to use the old austin motor company logo will begin putting thousands of them into electric vehicles next year according to austin s chief executive danny corcoran the new technology is a game changer it can help trigger the next industrial revolution the advantages over traditional electric vehicle batteries are enormous he said few will have heard of jackson s extraordinary invention the reason he says is that since he and his company metalectrique ltd came up with a prototype a decade ago he has faced determined opposition from the automobile industry establishment it has every reason not to give ground to a competitor that may in time render its own technology obsolete car industry sceptics claim trevor s technology is unproven and its benefits exaggerated but an independent evaluation by the government agency uk trade and investment said in that it was a very attractive battery based on well established technology and that it produced much more energy per kilogram than standard electric vehicle types game changer the aluminium air fuel cell stores far more energy than a conventional battery two years ago jackson claims motor manufacturers lobbied the foreign office to bar him from a prestigious conference for european businesses and governments at the british embassy in paris which was supposed to agree a blueprint for ensuring all new cars are electric by the bid to exclude him failed now with the signing of the austin deal it seems he is finally on the road to success he has also secured a grant for further research from the advanced propulsion centre a partner of the department for business innovation and skills his technology has been validated by two french universities he says it has been a tough battle but i m finally making progress from every logical standpoint this is the way to go jackson began working on new ways of powering electric vehicles after a distinguished engineering career he worked for rolls royce in derby helping to design nuclear reactors then took a commission in the royal navy where he served as a lieutenant on board nuclear submarines managing and maintaining their reactors before founding his own firm in he was working for bae systems where he first started looking at alternative green ways to power vehicles by then he and his partner kathryn were married the couple have eight children aged to and live in tavistock on the edge of dartmoor in devon in he began to investigate the potential of a technology first developed in the s scientists had discovered that by dipping aluminium into a chemical solution known as an electrolyte they could trigger a reaction between the metal and air to produce electricity at that time the method was useless for commercial batteries because the electrolyte was extremely poisonous and caustic after years of experimentation at his workshop in the cornish village of callington jackson s eureka moment came when he developed a new formula for the electrolyte that was neither poisonous nor caustic i ve drunk it when demonstrating it to investors so i can attest to the fact that it s harmless jackson says another problem with the s version was that it worked only with totally pure aluminium which is very expensive but jackson s electrolyte works with much lower purity metal including recycled drinks cans the formula which is top secret is the key to his device technically it should be described as a fuel cell not a battery either way it is so light and powerful that it could now be set to revolutionise low carbon transport because it supplies so much energy jackson gave me a demonstration he cut off the top of a can of coke drained it filled it with the electrolyte and clipped electrodes to it powering a small propeller the energy in this will keep the propeller spinning for a month he said you can see what this technology could do in a vehicle if you scale it up following last week s deal with austin that is exactly what is about to happen three immediate projects are about to go into production the first is to manufacture for the asian market some tuk tuks the three wheeler taxis used by the duke and duchess of cambridge last week during their royal visit to pakistan the second is to make electric bikes which will be cheaper and run for much longer than those made by rivals finally and most importantly the firm is to produce kits to convert ordinary petrol and diesel cars into hybrids by fitting them with aluminium air cells and electric motors on the rear wheels a driver will be able to choose whether to run the car on fossil fuel or electricity the cost of each conversion jackson says will be about and they will be available early next year this he adds will be the stepping stone to a full blown electric vehicle powered by aluminium air fuel cells the car industry has already poured massive investment into a very different type of battery lithium ion also found in devices such as computers and mobile phones lithium ion batteries are rechargeable almost every electric vehicle on the road uses them but they have big drawbacks as well as lithium they contain rare poisonous substances such as cobalt they can explode or catch fire as seen with the spate of incidents that forced samsung to recall tens of thousands of galaxy note phones in with repeated charging car sized models eventually become spent recycling them to recover the cobalt and lithium is extremely expensive about five times as much as the cost of disposing them and starting from scratch aluminium on the other hand is the planet s most abundant metal many of the factories that refine it from ore or recycled junk are powered by green renewable energy such as hydro electric dams and once an aluminium air fuel cell is spent it can be recycled very cheaply according to jackson the cost of recycling means the running costs of an aluminium air powered car would work out at p per mile the cost of a small hatchback s petrol comes to around p per mile more important lithium ion batteries are heavy accredited tests have shown that weight for weight jackson s fuel cell produces nine times as much energy as lithium ion nine times as many kilowatt hours of electricity per kilogram the luxury electric car maker tesla says its model s has a range of miles from one charge jackson says that if you drove the same car with an aluminium air cell that weighed the same as the lithium ion battery the range would be miles aluminium air cells also take up less space jackson claims that if the tesla were fitted with an aluminium air fuel cell that was the same size as its current battery it could run non stop for miles almost enough to get from land s end to john o groats and back again an average british family whose car will travel miles annually would need to change their fuel cell only a handful of times each year scientists call the weight to energy ratio energy density according to jackson because aluminium air fuel cells have a much greater density than lithium ion batteries they could be used in buses or big trucks if powered by lithium ion such vehicles would be unfeasibly heavy with the battery weighing as much as the freight he says you could easily stack numerous cells in this type of vehicle after all getting rid of their diesel fuel tanks will give you plenty of space jackson adds that aluminium air cells could also be used in aircraft we are in discussions with two aircraft manufacturers it s not going to be suitable for jets but it would work in propeller planes and be suitable for short haul passenger and cargo flights meanwhile the raw cost of a new aluminium air cell is much lower in a tesla jackson says the battery costs about an aluminium air fuel cell that would power the same car for longer would cost just drivers with cars that depend on lithium ion have to charge their batteries from the mains when they are spent a process that takes a long time often overnight but when an aluminium air cell became exhausted the driver would simply exchange it for a new one instead of a vast network of charging points all that is necessary are stores where cells can be swapped just as people already swap propane gas bottles swapping a battery says jackson takes about seconds he and corcoran say they are in advanced discussions with two major supermarket chains to provide this facility last week sir james dyson announced he was scrapping his plans to make electric cars because he had come to the conclusion they were not commercially viable even though he had invested millions the problem is says jackson he was using lithium ion if his cars had been based on aluminium air fuel cells the outcome might have been different ironically jackson s story so far bears more than a passing resemblance to dyson s dyson developed his bagless vacuum cleaner at a workshop at his home supported by his wife and just as jackson has had to battle the vested interests of the big motor companies it took dyson ten years to break through commercially because no distributor or existing manufacturer was prepared to upset the lucrative market for dust bags everyone knows that if we are really going to hit the government s target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the hardest nut to crack is transport jackson says we re just not going to do that with lithium ion apart from anything else it s no use for trucks which burn vast amounts of fossil fuel i know we are battling ferocious vested interests but the technological and environmental advantages of aluminium air are overwhelming and britain has a chance to become the world leader in it corcoran adds if you want to do something about the environment you can you can do it now with this product,pos

many people want to set aside half of earth as nature famed biologist e o wilson has argued in recent years that humans should set aside half of earth as nature an ambitious proposition to stave off mass extinction and safeguard the bulk of our planet s biodiversity including its people now a new poll reveals wilson isn t alone in his thinking on average the majority of survey respondents across a dozen countries said more than half of the planet s land and sea should be protected jonathan baillie executive vice president and chief scientist of national geographic society notes that this half earth plan is necessary to meet the paris climate target of limiting global warming to degrees fahrenheit degree celsius and achieve the united nations sustainable development goals people want what is scientifically needed for us to have a secure future he says the survey a collaboration between the national geographic society and ipsos polled adults in australia brazil china great britain india indonesia kenya mexico south africa south korea the united arab emirates and the united states researchers sought to understand how people in these countries all places where ngs works value nature and biological diversity information baillie says is vital for guiding policymakers and measuring the organization s long term impact please be respectful of copyright unauthorized use is prohibited in five countries with lower internet access mexico brazil south africa indonesia and china the online poll s results could be more representative of affluent urban dwelling citizens than of the general population a potential limitation to the survey researchers warn though people across the globe generally support conservation and saving wildlife the survey results also revealed a poor understanding about topics such as extinction in part due to lack of education here s what we lose when species go extinct for instance respondents in all countries were highly aware of the rapid pace of mass extinction underway yet they don t know exact details or understand the extent of what we could lose says baillie a striking majority of respondents weren t sure how much vertebrate populations have changed since decreased by about percent australians and americans were least knowledgeable that a quarter of the world s mammals could soon go the way of the dodo even with such knowledge gaps however one crucial takeaway from the poll is that regardless of political or cultural backgrounds baillie says very few people think extinction is acceptable overestimating protected areas concern about extinction was highest among people in mexico brazil and south africa countries with rich biodiversity and some of the world s greatest and great numbers of species now at risk of extinction mexico has the most with endangered species according to the international union for conservation of nature only a tiny sliver of the population in all countries surveyed an average of percent said extinction didn t concern them read how human activities are accelerating the extinction rate very few people think extinction is acceptable another intriguing finding was that many people dramatically overestimate the amount of the natural world that is currently protected notes edward maibach director of the center for climate change communication at george mason university in

restaurant and food pantry is a unique combination as a chef and vice president of food and beverage at firekeepers casino hotel michael mcfarlen was in a unique position to see the amount of food thrown away on a daily basis and mcfarlen s involvement with the south central food bank of michigan inc where he serves as president of the board gave him a similarly unique view of the number of

restaurant you just have to figure a way through that first year george says however the fire hub and the food pantry exceeded initial expectations for much different reasons the restaurant for its popularity and sustainability and the food pantry for the numbers of people it has been serving since its doors first opened mcfarlen says projected numbers were between and households when the pantry began operating that number quickly escalated to on each distribution day every monday from p m which equates to between to households per month the money to operate the fire hub is a combination of that comes from the tribe annually and from food and beverage revenue generated by the restaurant proceeds from the fire hub have been given to nonprofits including safe place and the food bank of south central michigan inc which recently received a check for mcfarlen says he d like to be in a position to make even larger donations to area charities on a more frequent basis we re building a fiscally responsible business that takes profits and gives to nonprofits he says as we get more and more involved we will give to many other charities and nonprofits robert elchert community impact associate for united way of the battle creek and kalamazoo region says the fire hub is a great united way partner because they apply their strengths and energy in specific ways to impact the community he cites the fire hub s hosting of united way pop up giving events and volunbeer activities for their young leaders group as examples of this partnership they support our work addressing food insecurity through the kendall street food pantry in concert with the food bank of south central michigan partnerships like this deliver a vital return on community and social responsibility elchert says from united way s perspective fire hub models the kind of collaboration that can address the toughest needs vulnerable individuals and families are facing food pantry clients are limited to one visit per month they are registered with the program which gives food pantry volunteers the ability to track their shopping habits and the number of people in their families in addition to notifying them about special distributions about percent of people who come through only come through once mcfarlen says we have people who need that one time distribution to get back on track he says about percent are people who make two or three visits they re not all from battle creek some of them work here but live in albion marshall and kalamazoo even though these people are employed they continue to struggle says heather mauney director of agency relations for the food bank in addition she says there is also a small number of people on a fixed income who are likely to always need their services and the services of others we ve seen a significant increase in households where one or both adults are working and they find themselves in some sort of crisis situation like an illness or car accident and they need our help mauney says we get a lot of people who are not used to how the system works we re able to cater to people who are working but still need a little help during the month she says the need has not decreased if anything it has increased and shifted the kendall street food pantry is the only one operated by the food bank of south central michigan which partners with more than agencies in a service area that includes barry branch calhoun hillsdale jackson kalamazoo lenawee and st joseph counties heather mauney director of agency relations for the food bank says it s not common for food banks to operate food pantries we cover a square mile service area and the logistics of overseeing and running a pantry miles away in lenawee doesn t make sense mauney says the opportunity presented itself with firekeepers and we just really didn t have a good reason to say no it makes sense for us to operate it because it gives us an opportunity to try out and test new things before rolling them out it is quite small compared to other pantries sometimes space can be a barrier for people who want to start a food pantry and we are able to show off how much we can do in a smaller space from the outset the food pantry was designed to be a choice pantry which allows individuals to come in and shop for whatever they want milk and meat are among the staples people ask for on a regular basis so the shelves are fairly well stocked with these items in addition there are canned goods boxed meals fruits and vegetables and a small selection of gluten free and vegan items the pantry has the look and feel of a store with shelves that contain neatly arranged food products and shopping carts we wanted to take away the stigma and make it more like they re going into a bodega or little store mcfarlen says mauney says across the industry more work has been done with to address the stigma of individuals needing food pantries her food bank is working with agencies across its service areas to make sure that those who come into a food pantry are treated with kindness food to stock the kendall street pantry shelves comes from a number of sources including the united states department of agriculture the kellogg and post companies several large retail donors and stores individual donors and firekeepers remember that food that mcfarlen says remains unused or untouched at the casino and hotel well that food is packaged up and taken to the food bank which then distributes to its partner agencies we purchased the equipment that is necessary to receive the proper licenses to flash freeze food from the buffet and we make family trays out of them george says in addition to canned goods and fresh fruits and vegetables we supplement them with family portions from the buffet last year more than pounds of frozen food from firekeepers made its way into area food pantries through the casino hotel s participation in the environmental protection agency s food recovery challenge as part of the challenge organizations pledge to improve their sustainable food management practices and report their results the food recovery challenge is part of epa s sustainable materials management program which seeks to reduce the environmental impact of materials through their entire life cycle we drop off about half a ton of food each month and the food bank decides where it goes mcfarlen says the frc gives you an idea of where you stand with other people trying to make an impact for a small community that we re in to make this kind of impact i could only imagine what they do in los angeles and new york the prepared meals can be microwaved or boiled but mcfarlen and his team also work with food pantry clients to show them how to prepare and cook fresh food including vegetables that are donated by area farmers this initiative came about after they learned that a lot of highly nutrient plant based foods were being thrown out particularly vegetables like rutabagas and kale we identified a shortcoming where families in need were getting the food but didn t know how to prepare or create a recipe that their family would eat he says the food bank and representatives with michigan state university extension services partnered with mcfarlen and his team to create recipes designed around what was being distributed he says about of these demonstrations happen each month throughout the food bank s eight county service area another component of firekeepers efforts to address food insecurity involves a greenhouse program with the goal of establishing free salad bars at area schools a variety of lettuces cucumbers tomatoes micro greens and other salad staples are being grown organically without pesticides at a greenhouse on land owned by the tribe under the watchful eye of an agricultural specialist and employees with the casino hotel s groundskeepers crew we looked at battle creek community schools and identified those schools with the highest number of students receiving free or reduced lunch we looked at how we could tackle lunch programs and decided to put together a greenhouse program where we could put free salad bars into those schools mcfarlen says the first harvest is expected to happen in about one week on april the first salad bar will open at athens schools once the community garden is fully operational mcfarlen says he will rely on volunteers to augment the work required to make it sustainable he anticipates getting support from casino employees his team members and individuals from the food bank mcfarlen says the majority of the day to day work and execution of the plans to broaden the scope and reach of firekeepers work to address food insecurity in the community is done by his team they have done an amazing job he says firekeepers ceo george says it s always been a priority of the tribe and firekeepers to be good stewards of the community the casino and band are phenomenal people she says they have such a huge heart and want to continue to be great partners in the community,pos

supreme court rules gay couples nationwide have a right to marry gay rights supporters celebrate outside the supreme court in washington after justices ruled that same sex couples have the right to marry no matter where they live june gay rights supporters celebrate outside the supreme court in washington after justices ruled that same sex couples have the right to marry no matter where they live jim bourg reuters a sea of cheering rainbow flag waving people filled the sidewalk in front of the supreme court to celebrate the decision a sea of cheering and rainbow flag waving people filled the sidewalk in front of the supreme court to celebrate the decision a sea of cheering and rainbow flag waving people filled the sidewalk in front of the supreme court to celebrate the decision a deeply divided supreme court on friday delivered a historic victory for gay rights ruling to that the constitution requires that same sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live the court s action rewarded years of legal work by same sex marriage advocates and marked the culmination of an unprecedented upheaval in public opinion and the nation s jurisprudence marriages began friday in states that had previously thwarted the efforts of same sex couples to wed while some states continued to resist what they said was a judicial order that changed the traditional definition of marriage and sent the country into uncharted territory as of the court s decision friday morning there were states where same sex couples were not allowed to marry justice anthony m kennedy who has written all of the court s decisions recognizing and expanding gay rights said the decision was based on the fundamental right to marry and the equality that must be afforded gay americans under the constitution same sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite sex couples and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right kennedy wrote he was joined in the ruling by the court s liberal justices ruth bader ginsburg stephen g breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan all four of the court s most conservative members chief justice john g roberts jr and justices antonin scalia clarence thomas and samuel a alito jr dissented and each wrote a separate opinion the common theme in their dissents was that judicial activism on the part of five members of the court had usurped a power that belongs to the people if you are among the many americans of whatever sexual orientation who favor expanding same sex marriage by all means celebrate today s decision wrote roberts who for the first time in his tenure marked his disagreement with a decision by reading part of his dissent from the bench celebrate the achievement of a desired goal celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner celebrate the availability of new benefits but do not celebrate the constitution it had nothing to do with it he wrote scalia called the decision a threat to american democracy saying it robs citizens of the freedom to govern themselves it s the first time roberts has had such a bold statement from the bench in a statement in the white house rose garden president obama hailed the decision this ruling is a victory for america this decision affirms what millions of americans already believe in their hearts when all americans are truly treated as equal we are more free of full screen autoplay close skip ad emotional scenes from same sex weddings around the u s on friday view photos couples all over the u s rushed

new york city clerk s office after their wedding the couple waited until the supreme court decision before getting married to each other brendan mcdermid reuters wait second to continue it wasn t until that obama declared that same sex couples should be able to marry and it was only last year that he said he thought the constitution provided such a right but by friday evening the rainbow colors that gay rights activists have adopted were projected onto the north face of the white house with the supreme court s ruling obama said today we can say in no uncertain terms that we have made our union a little more perfect read the full court opinion read roberts s dissent there were wild scenes of celebrations on the sidewalk outside the supreme court same sex marriage supporters had arrived early armed with signs and rainbow flags they cheered at the announcement of a constitutional right for gay marriage which did not legally exist anywhere in the world until the turn of this century the first legally recognized same sex marriages in the united states took place just years ago the result of a massachusetts state supreme court decision jim obergefell who became the face of the case obergefell v hodges when he sought to put his name on his husband s ohio death certificate as the surviving spouse said today s ruling from the supreme court affirms what millions across the country already know to be true in our hearts that our love is equal it is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past that from this day forward it will be simply marriage he said but austin r nimocks senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom a group that supports traditional marriage said today five lawyers took away the voices of more than million americans to continue to debate the most important social institution in the history of the world nobody has the right to say that a mom or a woman or a dad or a man is irrelevant there are differences that should be celebrated opponents of gay marriage are divided on whether to resist the ruling the supreme court used cases from michigan ohio kentucky and tennessee where restrictions against same sex marriage were upheld by an appeals court last year to find that the constitution does not allow such prohibitions kennedy over the past years has written the supreme court s most important gay rights cases overturning criminal laws on homosexual conduct protecting gays from discrimination and declaring that the federal government could not refuse to recognize same sex marriages performed where they were legal he often employs a lofty writing for history tone and friday s decision was no different referring to the couples who brought the cases before the court kennedy wrote it would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage their plea is that they do respect it respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness excluded from one of civilization s oldest institutions kennedy did not respond directly to the court s dissenters but he addressed the argument that the court was creating a constitutional right the right to marriage is fundamental he said the difference is society s evolving view of gay people and their rights he said the limitation of marriage to opposite sex couples may long have seemed natural and just but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest he wrote with that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter as in previous decisions kennedy did not spell out how courts should scrutinize laws that treated gays differently but mary bonauto who argued the case for gay plaintiffs at the supreme court said that message from kennedy s combined opinions is one of inclusion stop making rules for gay people scalia was a sharp critic of kennedy s style saying it was as pretentious as its content is egotistic the supreme court of the united states has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of john marshall and joseph story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie scalia wrote roberts wrote a lengthy dissent that was a point by point takedown of the majority opinion gay activists had wondered whether the year old justice might take note of the increasing public support for same sex marriage and find a way to join the majority on what they called the right side of history but he and the other dissenters said the question was not whether same sex marriage was a good idea but who should decide the court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the states and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia for the kalahari bushmen and the han chinese the carthaginians and the aztecs roberts wrote just who do we think we are roberts rejected a comparison to loving v virginia in which the court struck down bans on interracial marriage that did not change the age old definition of marriage as between a man and a woman he said he raised concerns that the decision could lead to polygamous marriages he mentioned a married threesome of lesbians called a throuple he noted that voters and legislators in only states had authorized same sex marriages and said it was better for gay marriage to be adopted through the democratic process than by judicial order he said religious leaders could take little comfort from the majority opinion that their beliefs would be respected that theme was picked up by alito in his dissent he said there could be bitter and lasting wounds from the decision and warned that the decision will be exploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissent the questions raised in the cases decided friday were left unanswered in when the justices last confronted the issue of same sex marriage a slim majority of the court said at the time that a key portion of the defense of marriage act withholding the federal government s recognition of same sex marriages was unconstitutional in a separate case that year the court said procedural issues kept it from answering the constitutional question in a case from california but allowed same sex marriages to resume in that state since then courts across the nation with the notable exception of the cincinnati based federal appeals court that left intact the restrictions in the four states at issue have struck down a string of state prohibitions on same sex marriage many of them passed by voters in referendums jerry markon david nakamura and sandhya

homeless man who found new jersey bombs is given apartment and job prospects lee parker needed a backpack for a job interview the next day he had been homeless for several years and carried his few possessions in a plastic bag so when he and a friend came across a new backpack sitting atop a garbage can next to the elizabeth new jersey train station last sunday night it was like divine

online crowdfunding hoping to raise just a little bit of money as a token of appreciation for the men he set a goal of that would be split three ways between them and the elizabeth coalition to house the homeless a local non profit organisation that has already found parker an apartment mr goncalves said mr white lives in subsidised housing on a fixed income within days the gofundme page that mr goncalves set up had doubled its goal and has raised more than mr goncalves who has become a spokesman for mr parker and mr white he has had inquiries for talk show appearances and from the national football league s new york jets to honour them at a game said he is eager to get the money distributed some have criticised his decision to give the local homeless organisation a third of the money

residents are part of the first wave of participants in ontario s experiment with basic income a monthly no strings attached payment of up to for people living in poverty those with disabilities receive an additional a month have your say read more handing out money for free harder than it looks opinion jennifer wells wynne s basic income experiment deserves to live a full life ontario launches basic income pilot for in hamilton thunder bay lindsay the three year pilot project which began in the hamilton and thunder bay areas last summer and in lindsay last fall is testing whether unconditional cash support can boost health education and housing for people on social assistance or earning low wages information gleaned from the three test sites will guide future provincial policy on how to better support all ontarians living in poverty the province is among several areas in the world experimenting with the idea of a basic income including finland which began a two year pilot last january after couch surfing for almost two years moore is using her basic income payment to look for stable housing my biggest focus is getting my own place and giving poor john his apartment back said moore who has been sleeping on her friend s living room sofa for about a year before joining the program in october the single mother of six and grandmother of was barely surviving on a month in basic needs allowance from ontario works the province s welfare program for people without disabilities her total income for was because moore was homeless she was not eligible for a shelter allowance that would have brought her monthly ontario works payment to just over but under the basic income experiment moore receives a month an amount that remains constant no matter where she lives it is giving me back my independence she said i don t feel so backed into a corner if i want to eat i can afford to buy something instead of going to a food bank or a soup kitchen moore and the others are among almost people enrolled so far in the test sites the province hopes to recruit participants including who will receive a basic income fill out surveys and participate in focus groups as part of the study a further won t get the monthly payments but will be paid to complete surveys and tracked as a control group thunder bay heating and fireplace installer taras harapyuk who hasn t worked since when he fell lifting a ladder out of his truck signed up for the pilot project last september he learned last week that his application was randomly selected as part of the control group i was very disappointed to hear i wasn t chosen to get the extra money harapyuk said but i will fill out the surveys i am happy to help adults in the three test sites age to with incomes under before taxes and deductions or couples with incomes under are eligible the income cut off for individuals with disabilities is if participants find employment or get a better job their basic income payments are reduced by cents for every dollar earned until they are no longer financially eligible but unlike social assistance which is adjusted monthly basic income payments are calculated once a year based on the participant s previous year s income tax return project administrators can make mid year adjustments if participants lose a job or go back to school change a living arrangement or become disabled after a slow start last summer enrolment topped at the end of january and the project is on track to be fully enrolled by the summer the government says we are well on our way to reaching full enrolment of participants into the pilot and have the measures in place to ensure this study is conducted with the utmost integrity rigour and ethical standards said social services minister helena jaczek and housing minister peter milczyn the government s co chairs for the pilot project what we learn from this pilot will help inform our longer term plans to better support people living on low incomes they said in a joint statement goold who has a developmental disability and suffers from severe arthritis was receiving about a month from the ontario disability support program odsp before her first basic income payment arrived in october since then her monthly income has increased by per cent to in addition to being able to buy a new walker with all the bells and whistles for about the extra money allowed her to take her husband don to the keg for his th birthday this month it s nice to be able to celebrate a milestone like everybody else she said fellow hamilton resident alana baltzer traded her monthly odsp benefit for a basic income of in october it meant baltzer who had previously shopped only at thrift stores was able to take advantage of black friday sales in november to buy her first new winter coat it has certainly come in handy with the cold weather she said loading loading loading loading loading loading while the cash means the cost of baltzer s rent geared to income bachelor apartment will rise to from a month her spending money has almost tripled after growing up on welfare and living in social housing most of her life baltzer says basic income could allow her to move into market housing away from all the fighting and noise this has already been a huge life change for me she said i have a full fridge i am eating more healthy food and she says she can finally afford a mouth guard to help correct chronic teeth problems caused by years of poor eating she has opened a tax free savings account and hopes to find someone to help manage her finances it still hasn t sunk in that i can afford things she said some participants may squander the money said laura cattari part time co ordinator with the hamilton roundtable for poverty reduction but as someone who relied on social assistance for years after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia and other health problems cattari believes people in the study are more likely to be reluctant to spend for example cattari says it took her more than a year after landing her job at the roundtable in before she felt comfortable buying something as basic as a new sweater that s what deprivation does over the long term it makes you afraid to change basic income will make people healthier and less stressed for sure but it takes time she said to change attitudes and outlook people need to feel comfortable and not stressed and i m not sure three years is long enough kwame mckenzie the province s special adviser on the initiative says researchers would love to have years to study the effect of a basic income but with automation and the rapidly changing workplace government needs information quickly to help guide possible changes to social assistance said mckenzie ceo of the wellesley institute health think tank and director of health equity at the centre for addiction and mental health the project is being independently assessed by researchers from st michael s hospital and mcmaster university who will track changes in employment health education food security and housing through surveys and focus groups we won t be comparing one person to another person we will be looking at groups of people who get the basic income compared to people who don t he said in lindsay a so called saturation site where about residents or almost everyone living in poverty will receive the basic income researchers will also be assessing how the community changes we will be looking at things like the level of unemployment and crime and comparing it to three or four other places that are as close to the gta as lindsay with the same size of population mckenzie said lindsay resident kathy mahood who joined the pilot project in october says she has already seen a difference in the community of about just north of peterborough people are relieved and happy for the extra help she said i really notice it when the cheques start coming out at the end of the month the stores are much busier the town is busy busy a lot busier than it was before there are lineups at the grocery store it s definitely injecting more money into the community mahood fell into deep poverty after a work related back injury and the death of her husband two years ago when she joined the pilot project in october she was living on about a month in federal canada pension plan disability benefits and proceeds from the sale of her house i figured i had a year and a half left before i would lose my apartment and have to rent a room it was pretty frightening she said but with in basic income every month on top of her disability benefits mahood has money for rent and healthy food and has begun making regular payments to clear her credit card debt if i am careful i should be debt free when the program ends in three years she said mahood was able to buy modest christmas gifts for her four grandchildren in december she could afford to buy ingredients for christmas baking she can put gas in her car and has money for repairs i feel healthier and i am not stressed all the time about money she said back in hamilton lance dingman acknowledges some people may be afraid to switch to basic

information detail tattoo removal program offers inmates a clean slate supporting inmate accountability inmates in the custody of the los angeles county sheriff s department may participate in its tattoo removal service a joint program of the inmate services bureau s education based incarceration ebi unit the medical services bureau and homeboy industries once considered permanent tattoos are now removable through laser treatments the highly successful tattoo removal service uses that advanced technology and benefits inmates who commit to bettering themselves while in custody so they can re enter our communities truly with a clean slate the tattoo removal service incentivizes inmates to engage in structured academic vocational life skills and other learning opportunities offered by ebi as participation in those courses and activities makes them eligible for tattoo removal treatments matching inmate motivations to community interests inmates regret having gotten tattoos for varying reasons some acquired their first tattoo as young as eleven years old before they could make a wise decision for others a tattoo not done by a skilled professional has produced an unsightly or distorted image and almost all inmates have experienced the negative social stigma attached to any tattoo compounded when it s offensive or prominently displayed on the face neck or hands an employer s no tattoo policy formal or not limits released inmates job and advancement opportunities finally many tattoos are gang related and inmates may no longer wish to be associated with that lifestyle no matter the reason the tattoo removal program gives these inmates a fresh start and facilitates their re integration into the community program process history and success the tattoo removal process uses a medical grade laser to produce a short pulse of intense light which passes through the top layers of skin and is selectively absorbed by the tattoo pigment this light breaks down the tattoo ink which is then absorbed by the body and the tattoo fades most patients need three to eight sessions scheduled every eight weeks to remove a tattoo completely many inmates start by getting one or two tattoos lasered to see the results not uncommonly they request treatment of other tattoos because removal is so successful if the removal process takes longer than the inmate s sentence ebi coordinates with homeboy industries to complete the removal at no cost to the released inmate the tattoo removal service began in february as a collaborative partnership between the los angeles county sheriff s department medical services bureau its inmate services bureau and homeboy industries the service is overseen by trained medical personnel and a custody assistant the program piloted with volunteer inmates and has expanded greatly as seen in yearly totals of treated inmates male female total male female total male female total note the tattoo clinic closed from early august to december to repair the laser machine january to september male female total a priceless benefit at no private or public cost at outside facilities removal of a single tattoo ranges in price from to per session if we recall that full removal may require five to twenty sessions we see that removing one tattoo might run the clinic currently owns four tattoo removal machines the first cost approximately while each subsequent machine cost an allocation of for the service also covers additional expenses of overtime and security yet the inmate welfare fund fully pays for all expenditures connected to the tattoo removal service incurring no additional outlay from the sheriff s department or the public recall also that if the removal process takes longer than an inmate s sentence ebi and homeboy industries cooperate to finish the released inmate s treatment for absolutely no fee the tattoo removal service gives inmates a visible change for the better and receives overwhelmingly positive feedback from participants the tattoo clinic along with ebi s academic vocational and life skills training stands as one of the department s most powerful means of helping inmates secure employment

us universities honor saudi students who died trying to rescue kids new outlook new faces behind saudi tourism revival jeddah as the pandemic appears to recede and the global travel sector returns to life saudi arabia is bringing in heavyweights to help promote the country to an international audience looking for new horizons to explore in much of the world tourists are waking up to new travel protocols and countries are finding new strategies to recover from the pandemic s effects others such as saudi arabia are tapping into the relatively new concept of domestic tourism while also welcoming international visitors who want to discover hidden gems in an exclusive interview with arab news gloria guevara manzo newly appointed chief special adviser to the saudi tourism minister ahmed al khateeb said that the kingdom s young tourism sector has an opportunity to reset its tone and strategies with the help of key partners in both the kingdom s private and public sector as well as international partners back ground gloria guevara manzo a former ceo and president of the world travel and tourism council wttc has more than years experience in the travel and tourism industry as mexico s tourism secretary from to she oversaw a number of key transformations dealing with the repercussions of the financial crisis and the h n pandemic a year later both of which heavily affected

council wttc has more than years experience in the travel and tourism industry as mexico s tourism secretary from to she oversaw a number of key transformations dealing with the repercussions of the financial crisis and the h n pandemic a year later both of which heavily affected the industry manzo was able to turn the industry around making mexico a global hotspot for tourism and creating a major jobs generator as the first female to head the wttc since its founding in she was responsible for the transformation of the organization leading a global effort to unite the tourism industry and encourage it to speak with one voice her recent appointment comes at a crucial time as the kingdom prepares to reopen its doors to international travelers having visited the kingdom in as part of the open saudi open hearts open doors event and the launch of a new tourist visa scheme manzo told arab news that she found the culture welcoming and saw tremendous potential i was very impressed with what i saw in and the commitment of course for the sector and that s what got me excited i see an amazing opportunity to have saudi become one of the top destinations in the world because it has the assets it has the people it has everything so i m quite excited for this opportunity to be part of this new transformation in numbers bn new tourism investments worth sr billion million m fund to develop key destinations across the kingdom the kingdom opened its borders to international tourists in september with a target of million visitors by and has since announced a number of mega projects to attract travelers as well as new tourism investments worth sr billion billion and a million fund to develop key destinations across the country but had a set of challenges that set back many plans for the kingdom s budding sector however with enough collaborative effort experts believe that the kingdom can bounce back faster than many european and other advanced economies one of the biggest challenges in was not only the pandemic it was the lack of international coordination or the opportunity for more international coordination and public and private collaboration in many countries said manzo now the good news is that we are leaders thank goodness saudi was the chair of the g because being the chair of the g helped us to foster that collaboration ahmed al khateeb made history and saudi arabia made history because for the first time he invited the private sector ceos to talk to the leaders of tourism and saudi arabia made history because for the first time it was included in the declaration and that was very important because before that as i said the collaboration was a challenge manzo believes that the kingdom emerged as a leader building bridges and encouraging collaboration which is crucial for the global recovery i see an amazing opportunity to have saudi become one of the top destinations in the world gloria guevara manzo after the easing of last year s lockdown residents of the kingdom are rediscovering the kingdom s attractions which has helped soften the blow according to manzo the sector can stay afloat by investing in the assets in its own backyard tourism in saudi arabia is very young the launch was in we still are in the process of creating some interesting and iconic destinations such as neom the red sea company alula and others but i believe that we already have an interesting offering for international travelers that is very appealing she said saudi arabia has opened several international tourism offices in major countries targeting markets in a global marketing push but a number of challenges remain sustainability is key to the success of the sector but accelerating the digital transformation and working with smes will help ensure continuation of international collaboration having worked extensively in the private and public sectors manzo said that one of the perks of jobs in tourism is mobility travel contributed to percent of global income and one in jobs depended on the sector the good news is that here we have a lot of potential and we have multiple sectors and tourism offers great opportunity and jobs what s interesting is that people don t have to move the beauty about tourism is that you can create the jobs in your city in your destination for example you live in jeddah it s an amazing city a beautiful city that can have a lot of visitors and create a lot of opportunities for the people she added,pos
analysis uk renewables generate more electricity than fossil fuels for first time in the third quarter of the uk s windfarms solar panels biomass and hydro plants generated more electricity than the combined output from power stations fired by coal oil and gas carbon brief analysis reveals during the three months of july august and september renewables generated an estimated total of terawatt hours twh compared with just twh from fossil fuels the analysis shows this is the first ever quarter where renewables outpaced fossil fuels since the uk s first public electricity generating station opened in it is another symbolic milestone in the stunning transformation of the uk s electricity system over the past decade nevertheless a lack of progress in other parts of the economy means the uk remains far off track against its upcoming legally binding carbon targets let alone the recently adopted goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by transformative decade at the start of this decade in the twh generated from fossil fuels accounted for around three quarters of the uk total it was also more than times as much electricity as the twh that came from renewables since then electricity generation from renewable sources has more than quadrupled and demand has fallen leaving fossil fuels with a shrinking share of the total this shift is shown in the chart below with the declining quarterly output from power stations burning coal oil and gas in blue and rising generation from renewables in red the quarterly chart also reflects the seasons with demand higher in winter and lower in summer windfarm output is well matched with this cycle as it tends to be windier in winter quarterly electricity generation in the uk between and the third quarter of in terawatt hours with fossil fuel output shown with a blue line coal oil and gas and renewables shown in red wind biomass solar and hydro source beis energy trends and carbon brief analysis of data from bm reports chart by carbon brief using highcharts the chart above shows that electricity generation from fossil fuels has halved since from twh down to twh in the most recent month period gas now contributes the vast majority of that shrinking total as coal plants close down ahead of a planned phaseout in these ageing power stations were mostly built in the s and s and are increasingly uneconomic to run due to co prices market forces and pollution rules in the third quarter of some of uk electricity generation was from coal oil and gas including from gas and less than from coal and oil combined another came from renewables including from wind from biomass and from solar nuclear contributed most of the remainder generating of the total while it is unlikely that renewables will generate more electricity than fossil fuels during the full year of it is now a question of when rather than if this further milestone will be passed this summer national grid predicted that zero carbon sources of electricity wind nuclear solar and hydro but not biomass would generate more electricity than fossil fuels during carbon brief s analysis through to the third quarter of the year is in line with this forecast new capacity over the past year the most significant reason for rising renewable generation has been an increase in capacity as new offshore windfarms have opened the megawatt mw hornsea one project was completed in october becoming the world s largest offshore windfarm the mw beatrice offshore windfarm was completed in q of this year these schemes add to the more than mw of offshore capacity that started operating during further capacity is already being built including the mw east anglia one project that started generating electricity this year and will be completed in in total government contracts for offshore wind will take capacity from nearly mw today to around mw by the mid s the government and industry are jointly aiming for at least mw of offshore wind capacity by with two further contract auctions already expected in september the latest auction round produced record low deals for offshore windfarms that will generate electricity more cheaply than expected market prices and potentially below the cost of running existing gas plants other contributors to the recent increase in renewable generation include the opening of the mw lynemouth biomass plant in northumberland last year and the addition of hundreds of megawatts of new onshore wind and solar farms another new mw biomass plant being built on teesside with a scheduled opening in early is facing major delays according to the department of business energy and industrial strategy beis the rise in renewable output during the first half of was down to these increases in capacity with weather conditions not unusual for the time of year some two thirds of electricity generated from biomass in the uk comes from plant biomass primarily wood pellets burnt at lynemouth and the drax plant in yorkshire the remainder comes from an array of smaller sites based on landfill gas sewage gas or anaerobic digestion the committee on climate change says the uk should move away from large scale biomass power plants once existing subsidy contracts for drax and lynemouth expire in using biomass to generate electricity is not zero carbon and in some circumstances could lead to higher emissions than from fossil fuels moreover there are more valuable uses for the world s limited supply of biomass feedstock the ccc says including carbon sequestration and hard to abate sectors with few alternatives in terms of fossil fuel generating capacity the uk s remaining coal plants are rapidly closing down well ahead of a deadline to phase out unabated burning of the fuel by march just four coal plants will remain in the uk utility firms have plans to build up to mw of new gas capacity including mw at drax recently given government planning approval despite the fact that government projections suggest only around mw might be needed by it is unlikely that all of the planned new gas capacity will get built the schemes are generally reliant on winning contracts under the uk s capacity market which is designed to ensure electricity supply is always sufficient to meet demand the rise of renewables means that gas generation is likely to continue falling in the uk whether or not this new capacity gets built nevertheless the uk is unlikely to meet its legally binding goal of cutting overall emissions to net zero by unless progress in the electricity sector is matched by reductions in other parts of the uk economy such as heating and transport consecutive months carbon brief s electricity sector analysis shows that renewables are also estimated to have generated more electricity than fossil fuels during the individual months of august and september the first time there have been two consecutive such months previously renewables beat fossil fuels in september the first ever whole month and then again in march this means that there have only ever been four months where renewables outpaced fossil generation of which three have been this year and two in the last two months this is shown in the chart below which also highlights the greater month to month variability in electricity generation and demand which is overlaid on top of the broader seasonal cycles

the individual days carbon brief analysis suggests this is more than one third of the days in the year so far and includes of the days in the third quarter of although this is not a majority of days the aggregate output during the quarter was higher for renewables this is because their excess over fossil fuels was large on some days as expected from the monthly aggregates in the chart above these

such days by the same point in this is shown in the chart below which also highlights the fact that there had never been any days with higher renewable generation until cumulative count of days each year when electricity generation from renewables was higher than that from fossil fuels prior to there were no days when renewables outpaced fossil fuels source carbon brief analysis of data from beis energy trends and bm reports chart by carbon brief using highcharts there have already been nearly as many higher renewable days in the first three quarters of at as there were in the whole of which saw such days there were only such days in just in and in the first ever day when uk renewables generated more electricity than fossil fuels was april methodology the figures in the article are from carbon brief analysis of data from beis energy trends chapter and chapter as well as from bm reports the figures from bm reports are for electricity supplied to the grid in great britain only and are adjusted to include northern ireland in carbon brief s analysis the bm reports numbers are also adjusted to account for electricity used by power plants on site and for generation by plants not connected to the high voltage national grid this includes many onshore windfarms as well as industrial gas combined heat and power plants and those burning landfill gas waste or sewage gas by design the carbon brief analysis is intended to align as closely as possible to the official government figures on electricity generated in the uk reported in beis energy trends table briefly the raw data for each fuel is adjusted with a multiplier derived from the ratio between the reported beis numbers and unadjusted figures for previous quarters carbon brief s method of analysis has been verified against published beis figures using hindcasting this shows the estimates for total electricity generation from fossil fuels or renewables to have been within of the beis number in each quarter since q data before then is not sufficient to carry out the carbon brief analysis for example in the second quarter of a carbon brief hindcast estimates gas generation at twh whereas the published beis figure was twh similarly it produces an estimate of twh for renewables against a beis figure of twh the carbon brief estimated totals for fossil fuels and renewables are very close in q coming within twh of each other this means that despite the relatively low level of uncertainty in the estimates their relative position could be reversed in the official beis data this serves to emphasise the fact that the broader trend of decline for fossil fuels and an increase for renewables is of far greater significance than the precise figures for any individual quarter in contrast to carbon brief s analysis figures published by consultancy enappsys for the third quarter of suggest that fossil fuels generated slightly more electricity than renewables there are several reasons for this difference first the company s analysis is for great britain only whereas carbon brief s covers the uk overall second it reports on electricity supplied in the country including imports whereas carbon brief estimates the amount of electricity generated within the uk only third carbon brief s analysis is by design aligned with the quarterly beis energy trends data for electricity generation whereas enappsys uses its own approach for comparison enappsys reported for the second quarter of that twh was supplied in gb from gas whereas beis reports that twh was generated in the uk similarly enappsys reported twh coming from renewables against a beis figure of twh,pos
we reported on a nonprofit hospital system that sues poor patients it just freed thousands from debt propublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they re published this article was produced in partnership with mlk which is a member of the propublica local reporting network memphis tenn the city s largest nonprofit hospital system has erased the debts owed by more than patients it sued for unpaid hospital bills less than two months after announcing an overhaul of its debt collection processes the dramatic shift was prompted by an mlk propublica investigation that revealed that methodist le bonheur healthcare filed more than debt lawsuits from through including against its own employees methodist had doggedly pursued low income defendants who had little ability to pay often garnishing their meager paychecks the single page case satisfied notices filed by methodist are coming into the shelby county general sessions court faster than staff can process them a court administrator estimated a backlog of about methodist notices waiting to be entered into the court s system get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter from july through tuesday the court had logged more than notices submitted by the hospital system that wiped away patients debts that s more than nine times the number of notices filed by methodist in the first six months of for now it appears that methodist is no longer using the courts as a collection agency a practice that was roundly criticized by health care experts some elected officials and members of the united methodist church with which methodist is affiliated since july the hospital has not filed any new debt collection lawsuits or garnishment attempts methodist s turnaround elated defendants and consumer advocates among the defendants who no longer owe is carrie barrett a part time kroger employee featured in one of the mlk propublica articles barrett s case began in july when a two night stay at methodist bonheur healthcare where doctors performed a heart catherization left her with a bill in methodist sued her for more than one third of which was attorney s fees over the years thanks to interest and court costs barrett s debt climbed to more than if she paid per month as ordered by the court she would be by the time she paid it off barrett said she received a call nearly two weeks ago from an administrator who said the hospital had reviewed her records he said the balance is zero i said you don t know how good that sounds to my ears jessica curtis a senior adviser at community catalyst a national advocacy organization has followed other nonprofit hospitals that have been the subject of similar media reports i was trying to remember when have i seen such a rapid switch curtis said i don t know that i ve seen that before the scale of what they are attempting to rectify is really commendable from what we ve seen thus far because the case satisfied notices do not include the amount owed the total dollar amount of debt methodist forgave could not immediately be quantified methodist did not answer questions about how much debt it had forgiven or how many additional cases it has yet to review we are implementing the policies and practices we announced in july and we have reached out individually to patients who currently have legal proceedings to provide information related to their specific situation a hospital spokesperson said in a statement sent tuesday evening the hospital said formal letters to the patients were sent last week and patients with questions should call the hospital s billing department at no date has been set to resume court collections nonprofit hospitals are generally exempt from local state and federal taxes in return the federal government expects them to provide a significant community benefit including charity care and financial assistance methodist which operates five hospitals in shelby county does provide some charity care but experts faulted it for its aggressive collections practices in a city where nearly in residents live below the poverty line its handling of poor patients began with a financial assistance policy that unlike many of its peers around the country all but ignored patients with any form of health insurance no matter their out of pocket costs if they were unable to afford their bills patients then faced what experts said is rare a licensed collection agency owned by the hospital lawsuits followed finally after the hospital won a judgment it would repeatedly try to garnish patients wages which it did in a far higher share of cases than other nonprofit hospitals in memphis stacks of notices erasing the balance on thousands of methodist le bonheur healthcare lawsuits await processing at shelby county general sessions court courtesy of the shelby county general sessions court methodist repeatedly refused to make its executives available for interviews but it sent statements defending itself noting how it is the only health care system that has hospitals in all four quadrants of shelby county and that it provided more than million in community benefit it did not address why its financial assistance policy was less generous than those of its peers or why it garnished wages in a higher percentage of cases than other hospitals but on june three days after the mlk propublica investigation was published methodist ceo michael ugwueke said in a column published in the commercial appeal that the hospital would spend the next days reviewing its collections and financial assistance policies days later methodist announced it would suspend court collection activities over unpaid hospital bills in the weeks that followed the hospital s attorney r alan pritchard dropped dozens of suits that had been on the court docket on july the hospital announced wide reaching reforms we were humbled to learn that while there s so much good happening across our health system each day we can and must do more ugwueke said in a media conference call under the new policy financial assistance will be provided to patients earning up to of the federal poverty line or for a family of three the previous policy applied to uninsured patients with incomes up to of the federal poverty line methodist said more than half of the population of greater memphis would be eligible for assistance under the new policy the hospital also said it would no longer accept court ordered interest on medical debt nor would it seek to collect attorney s fees or court costs from patients and it said it would raise its minimum wage to an hour by mid september and to an hour by january the lowest paid employees made an hour and about of workers earned less than an hour the hospital reported in response to mlk s living wage survey the pay increase signaled that methodist took the issue seriously curtis said the inclusion of wages means someone has realized not just the symptom of the problem but the core root of the problem this is a clearly promising start she said it s unclear whether methodist will resume suing patients for unpaid bills and the hospital has not said how many additional case satisfied notices it could file plaintiffs cannot refile lawsuits after the case has been marked satisfied one of the defendants featured in the investigation was a methodist housekeeper who asked that her name not be used for fear that the hospital would fire her for talking to a reporter in methodist sued her for the cost of hospital stays to treat chronic abdominal pain she experienced before the hospital hired her she owed about including around in attorney s fees read more the nonprofit hospital that makes millions owns a collection agency and relentlessly sues the poor in memphis methodist le bonheur healthcare has brought lawsuits for unpaid medical bills in just five years in january a general

commercial whaling may be over in iceland as public opinion changes and consumption of whale meat declines commercial whaling may be one step closer to a permanent end in iceland and possibly the world for the second year in a row iceland one of three remaining whaling nations will not hunt any whales iceland already harvested the lowest number of whales among the whaling holdouts which include japan and norway since resuming whaling in after a year pause the island nation has killed whales recent announcements by the country s two whaling companies suggest that the annual hunt may be coming to an end whales are worth millions of dollars in the fight against climate change here s why gunnar bergmann jonsson managing director of the minke whaling company ip utgerd told afp on april i m never going to hunt whales again i m stopping for good on the same day kristj n loftsson ceo of hvalur told the icelandic newspaper morgunbladid that his ships would not be setting out to sea this summer one reason loftsson said was the social distancing restrictions imposed by the covid pandemic which would make crewing vessels and processing whales impractical but hvalur s ships also stayed in port in and loftsonn acknowledged that there were bigger issues at play for one his company hunts fin whales primarily for export to japan which has become a difficult market last year japan ended years of whaling in the antarctic withdrew from the international whaling commission iwc and shifted its focus to hunting whales in its own coastal waters and exclusive marine zone the news was widely greeted with dismay by anti whaling activists while japanese officials presented it as an act of defiance and principle the decision was more likely because consumption of whale meat in japan has been falling for years per capita the japanese now eat only about an ounce a year and as a consequence approximately tons of unsold whale meat is stored in a growing stockpile loftsson told morgunbladid that japanese government subsidies keep local whalers afloat and make it impossible for his company to compete requests for comment from loftsson and jonsson were not provided as of press time another issue for loftsson is that public opinion on whaling has changed says rni finnsson chairman of the iceland nature conservation association what has changed is that the fishing industry is not willing to support him anymore they feel that iceland needs to be able to export fish to the u s market and they don t want to continue defending whaling i think he s done this change in attitude is seemingly a consequence of a dramatic shift in iceland support for hunting whales has declined as the income derived from watching them has climbed whale watching in iceland is booming between and the number of people who went on whale watching trips in iceland increased by between and percent annually meaning that the yearly increase in whale watchers was greater than the number of people who went cetacean spotting in in the northern coastal village of hauganes population the number of whale watching visitors rose from in to by whale watching trips that depart from the icelandic capital of reykjavik operate in the eastern part of a large body of water called faxafl i bay which in recent years is also where minke whaling has taken place in a small portion of the bay was set aside as a sanctuary to prevent whale watchers and whalers from descending on the same whales in november following a campaign by icewhale the country s association of whale watching companies the government announced a significant expansion of that sanctuary that effectively eliminated the whalers hunting grounds between and of minkes caught in iceland were killed in an area now within the sanctuary s new boundaries that loss of access also has coincided with a precipitous decline in domestic consumption of a food that finnsson says wasn t exactly looked at lovingly even during its heyday when i was a kid in akureyri in the north minke whale meat was our wednesday meat he recalls with a smile it was very cheap and it was not the sort of thing a family would offer on sundays it was nothing good by a gallup poll conducted for the international fund for animal welfare ifaw found that only one percent of icelanders ate whale meat regularly while percent claimed never to have eaten it at all much of the domestic market was increasingly geared toward foreign visitors who were encouraged to sample it as a traditional delicacy a campaign by ifaw and icewhale which sought to gently discourage tourists from eating whale meat has caused consumption by visitors to fall by half since the lack of enthusiasm for whale meat in iceland is mirrored in norway where the number of whaling vessels dropped by almost half from to among them these remaining ships kill process and sell barely a third of the country s official quota iceland s experience suggests that internal indifference

world s biggest fund manager issues darth vader style threat to oust bosses who ignore climate change the world s biggest fund manager has threatened to vote out directors of companies that fail to address the risks posed to their businesses by climate change in a post on its website blackrock which controls assets worth trillion about trillion said climate risk was a systemic issue it said it planned to engage with the companies that are most exposed to climate risk over this year to help them tell investors like blackrock about the financial impacts of global warming and the shift to a low carbon economy in an associated briefing note blackrock made clear how serious it was about the issue pointing to a letter written to businesses by its chief executive larry fink which had said while we are patient investors we are not infinitely patient climate risk will be one of the key engagement themes that the investment stewardship team will prioritize in and the team s recent work on this issue will inform our assessment of shareholder proposals on the topic the briefing note said over the course of we intend to engage companies most exposed to climate risk to understand their views on reporting their climate risks for directors of companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate risk the expectation will be for the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business and management s approach to adapting and mitigating the risk blackrock said it would vote in favour of proposals on climate risk that clearly address a gap which would otherwise lead to material economic disadvantage to the company and its shareholders and if this was not enough it promised to use its power to get rid of directors who were part of the problem ultimately the board is responsible for protecting the long term economic interests of shareholders and we may vote against the re election of certain directors where we believe they have not fulfilled that duty particularly in markets where shareholder proposals are not common blackrock said reacting to blackrock s new guidance boston based lawyer seth jaffe wrote a blog post called investors don t think that climate change is a hoax blackrock is losing its patience referring to donald trump s infamous claim that global warming was made up by china he highlighted mr fink s

when your dog s day is over it dreams of you says harvard psychologist dogs probably dream about their owners while they sleep an expert has said dr deirdre barrett a clinical and evolutionary psychologist at harvard medical school has spent years studying sleep behaviour in humans extrapolating from her work with people she said it is likely dogs dream about their everyday experiences just like humans this collar shows if your dog is sad humans dream about the same things they re interested in by day though more visually and less logically dr barrett told people there s no reason to think animals are any different since dogs are generally extremely attached to their human owners it s likely your dog is dreaming of your face your smell and of pleasing or annoying you she cautioned there is no way to know for sure what dogs see when they dream or even if they dream at all but said most mammals have a similar sleep cycle to humans going into a deep sleep stage in which the brain is much less active and then into periods of activity called rapid eye movement rem sleep in which dreams occur for humans that certainly makes it the best guess that other mammals are dreaming too she said the dogs from instagram show all the dogs from instagram the dogs from instagram noodle the dachshund is just over a year old and comes with her own hashtag oodlesofnoodle the dogs from instagram three year old staffie ramsey was malnourished when he was adopted as a puppy but is now big and boisterous with ripped muscles and a cheeky grin the dogs from instagram winny the welsh corgi has been credited with the breed s upsurge in popularity the dogs from instagram bruno the miniature dachshund has followers the dogs from instagram mika the husky has followers the dogs from instagram elle the french bulldog has followers but while dogs dote on their human companions cats maintain their waking aloofness when they sleep we actually know more about cats dreams because one of the earliest sleep researchers michel jouvet destroyed the tiny area in cat brains that inhibits movements during rem sleep dr barrett said cats lay quietly through the other stages of sleep and when rem began they leapt up stalked pounced arched their backs and hissed they looked like they were hunting mice in their dreams cats are better than dogs dr barrett confirmed that dogs too are probably acting out their dreams when their legs move in running motion in their sleep the psychologist also offered advice to pet owners who want to make sure their animals have good dreams she said the best way to give ourselves or our children better dreams is to have happy daytime experiences and to get plenty of sleep in a safe and comfortable environment it s a good bet this is also best for pets dreams,pos

police chief gives opioid addicts hope nashville north carolina cnn he s only years old but he struggled with addiction for more than a decade thomas spikes now owes his sobriety to none other than the chief of police in this small eastern north carolina town he saved my life for sure he said i owe a lot to him and the program thomas spikes credits the police with saving his life and putting him on the road to recovery from his opioid addiction that program called the hope initiative is a collaboration between nashville s town manager hank raper and chief thomas bashore as deaths from opioids continue to dramatically rise across america topping the list for unintentional deaths at a higher rate than car accidents north carolina saw more than a increase from to there s no clear characteristic of what a heroin or opioid addiction looks like it s not a white problem it s not a black problem it s not a hispanic problem middle class working class upper class it affects all peoples of all walks of life raper said so the conversation began on how this small town of where everyone knows their neighbors could get ahead of the problem the hope initiative modeled after the innovative angel program in gloucester massachusetts which opens the way for addicts to get police assistance and medical help without fear of arrest is a way of rethinking law enforcement s role in responding to this growing epidemic they walk into the front door if they have drugs or paraphernalia on them at any time they can turn it in to us at that time and have no charges filed and we facilitate them into recovery bashore said drugs but no arrest so far the department has seen paraphernalia syringes cookers pipes and injection rigs turned in we have actually had individuals who have brought in heroin bags and turned that over because they knew that they were going to get into recovery and they didn t want that around when they got out bashore said possession of heroin in north carolina is a felony charge and having paraphernalia is a misdemeanor bashore and raper met with the county s district attorney to ensure he was on board with not charging people he was in full support hope which is not an acronym but the town s offer of help in capital letters kicked off on february eight days into the program the first addict came into the police department it was eye opening recalled bashore that individual came in and we spent the better part of hours getting him processed only then did i leave the hospital and come back to the police department to start calling facilities to start having him placed after he left detox you can spend hours on the phone calling facilities saying do you have a bed chief escorts addicts to detox bashore has driven many of the men and women of hope to a detox facility himself he has built personal relationships with several rehabilitation facilities across the state that now alert him when there is space available and the business card he passes out has his personal cellphone number nashville north carolina chief of police thomas bashore saw the increase in opioid deaths in his town and new he had to do something about it so he started a program called the hope initiative in which addicts can turn themselves into police with their drugs and paraphernalia rather than face arrest they get help getting into a program to fight addiction my cellphone it rings all the time each participant who comes through the program and all their family members have it so when they need something they reach out bashore said hope has created a positive result between the police and the community bashore said he wants people to understand that substance abuse is a disease and the police department s intention is to be supportive not only for their benefit but for the community benefit nashville north carolina a town of offers an unique program to help opioid addicts recover addicts can turn themselves into police with their drugs and paraphernalia rather than face arrest they get help getting into a program to fight addiction since the program began bashore said crime is down in the town about miles northeast of raleigh we ve had a pretty significant drop in our crimes that are associated with substance abuse disorder things like shoplifting and larcenies and breaking into cars hope is not limited to residents of nashville people from all over the state have walked through the police station doors as well as people from california and pennsylvania the program comes at no cost to the participants it is funded through small grants fundraisers and donations the chief paid for the first two months that i was there and the rehab i was at recalled spikes four months removed from rehab he is now sober after being involved with drugs and alcohol for more than half his life unlikely friendship spikes told cnn he first used drugs when he was years old it started off with just smoking weed he said then occasional pills and it progressed through the years his addiction became a to a day habit at its worst heroin became his drug of choice he was caught with it in october and sent to jail his arrest led to his first encounter with bashore spikes was skeptical of police and their offer to help you don t talk to cops you don t associate with them they re not your friends he said that changed quickly spikes said he recognized bashore was solely there to help him no questions asked the chief never tried to pry into anything in my life in that era spikes said he doesn t care who you hang out with what kind of drugs you do spikes has cycled through countless rehab facilities but said his life made a complete turnaround because of the chief and the hope initiative he saved my life for sure because if it wasn t for the hope initiative i wouldn t have gotten help as he hops back on the tiller in the hot summer sun he smiles and says my life has done a i m working i have a vehicle a house i have a beautiful girlfriend with a baby on the way and as for bashore he lives up to the name of his program he hopes to continue to battle the opioid epidemic in his town one addict at a time of those people that have come through the program i ve actually been to two funerals knowing what the alternative could have been for thomas who just recently disclosed to me that his girlfriend s pregnant he s going to be a father he said so that s an amazing thing that touches me deeply,pos
oregon law to decriminalize all drugs goes into effect offering addicts rehab instead of prison portland ore for janie gullickson rock bottom came both slowly and all at once a longtime drug and alcohol addict gullickson pushes back on the idea that one terrible day on the street leads to an epiphany and a climb back to normalcy that s what happens in movies not real life i lived in the bottom for years says gullickson for me and people like me i laid there and wallowed in it for a long time but if she has to pick the lowest point one that lasted years not days she says it came shortly after she hit in at that time gullickson had five kids ages to by four different men she came home from work one day as a locksmith to find that her ex husband had taken her two youngest and left the state horrified devastated and convinced that this was the beginning of the end her life spiraled she dropped her other son off with his dad left her two daughters with her mom and soon became an iv meth user in prison six years later gullickson was contemplating joining an intensive recovery program when a striking magnetic gorgeous black woman walked in the room held up a mug shot and started talking about being in the very chairs where we were sitting gullickson remembers there was life on the other side of addiction and prison the woman said but you have to fight for it gullickson believed her i remember thinking i may not be able to do all that be what she was but maybe i could do something different than this gullickson says that day i felt the door open to change and healing now gullickson executive director of the mental health addiction association of oregon is determined to give other addicts the same opportunity that s why she pushed for the passage of measure first of its kind legislation that decriminalizes the possession of all illegal drugs in oregon including heroin cocaine meth and oxycodone instead of a criminal justice based approach the state will pivot to a health care based approach offering addicts treatment instead of prison time those in possession will be fined a citation that will be dropped if they agree to a health assessment the law goes into effect monday and will be implemented over the next decade by the state officials at the oregon health authority advocates say the pivot will be life changing for thousands of oregonians one of the things people misunderstand is how criminalization creates barriers to treatment says kassandra frederique the executive director of the drug policy alliance a national nonprofit dedicated to legalizing illicit drug use if we want people to make different choices we have to give them more options ending criminalization will do leaps and bounds around ending shame which automatically opens people up for other opportunities nationally others are hopeful this could be the first in a wave of progressive measures that undo years of damage caused by drug criminalization which disproportionately imprisoned people of color across the u s i hope that we all become more enlightened across this country that substance abuse is not something that necessitates incarceration but speaks to other social ills lack of health care lack of treatment things of that nature says rep bonnie watson coleman d n j an outspoken critic of the war on drugs if you re white and wealthy you get an opportunity to get a break go home to your family and go into some kind of health care environment but it s often different for people of color watson coleman says according to the drug policy alliance prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue a mandatory minimum sentence for black people as for white people charged with the same offense and many people of color do time for possession alone in there were more than million drug arrests more than were for possession only watson coleman also points out that it s far more expensive to pay to incarcerate someone than get them treatment rehab programs not only empower people she says but they also save communities money addiction amid covid coronavirus can be deadly for people recovering from addiction i will love you unconditionally always naomi campbell pens moving tribute to godson harry brant after accidental overdose in early the oregon health authority announced a year plan to limit health inequities across the state measure will be a crucial step in that fight says steve allen the behavioral health director at the authority oha helping addicts fight addiction means more than just straight drug rehab he says addiction is rarely an isolated event as people struggling with it are typically juggling other crises including mental illness physical or dental health care issues and homelessness too many people spend too much of their lives cycling in and out of jails and emergency departments allen says instead of getting the wraparound services they need a move to take care of the whole individual will pay huge dividends what we know is that punishment for addiction doesn t work and doesn t improve outcomes for people allen says he points out that the law is going into effect at a critical time since the covid pandemic started in spring overdoses in oregon have skyrocketed by the program will be paid for by redistributing existing marijuana dollars that come from the state s cannabis tax which allen calls a huge advantage because it likely won t be dependent on whims of the local economy marijuana funds have gone up recently he noted advocates hope other states will follow gullickson who has been sober since after a few detours already sees a shift nationally in the conversation around addiction she points to the october presidential debate when then democratic nominee joe biden said no one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem and expressed support for drug diversion programs having biden in the white house now makes a huge difference gullickson says frederique at the drug policy alliance agrees and says the biden administration s promise to bring science back to the white house will play an important role going forward we need to ground our policies in science instead of stigma and punishment frederique says undoing trump s policies what biden did in his first week as president in as the house studied and voted on bills aimed at helping solve america s opioid crisis watson coleman introduced her own legislation that called for congress to formally apologize for the war on drugs and acknowledge the damage it had done to communities of color it also called for future drug policy to be ground in evidence based health care solutions the war on drugs watson coleman says was used as a weapon as a tool to disrupt our communities particularly during the richard nixon era it was a disguise to break up and weaken our communities it wasn t a war on drugs it was a war on poor brown and black men and women and it did terrible things to families for generations but she s optimistic change is coming so is gullickson who s committed to helping in any and every way she can now married and a grandmother of she s slowly rebuilt relationships with almost all her children gullickson shares her story and all its warts because she wants others to know no matter how ugly or decimated their lives are now something different is waiting for them she believes legislation like measure will create an environment where instead of being somewhere accidentally and hoping someone will walk in and give you hope we re doing that proactively she knows it ll take time to fully implement and there will be issues along the way she also knows if it works it could be implemented in other places and millions of other people like her who once felt hopeless alone and isolated could find something else something good to live for if we do this right in oregon i think there s a will to do it everywhere she says we ve got a huge responsibility to show that this is the right thing and it can work,pos

haslam outlines tuition free community college plan for adults adam tamburin usa today network tennessee in a surprise announcement during his state of the state address monday gov bill haslam outlined a plan to expand the tennessee promise scholarship model to allow adults to attend community college tuition free the new scholarship which will come before the general assembly this year in the tennessee reconnect act is likely to further cement haslam s national reputation as a change agent in higher education if state lawmakers sign off on the program tennessee would become the only state in the nation to offer tuition free community college to high school students and adults before announcing the new scholarship for adults haslam emphasized the early success of tennessee promise which has sent more than high school students to community and technical colleges tuition free since he proposed it during his state of the state speech expanding that model to adults he said was a natural next step we need to reach the working mother that went to college but didn t complete or the son with sons of his own who like his dad never went to college but knows that he needs to upgrade his skills haslam said in his prepared remarks tonight i m introducing the next step in making certain that everyone in tennessee has the opportunity to earn their degree the lawmakers and officials packed inside the house chambers responded to the announcement with a thunderous standing ovation that lasted several seconds the haslam administration has tried for years to entice adults without degrees to enroll in college many times under the reconnect banner but the new scholarship program would represent the most sweeping effort by far with more than million adults potentially eligible under haslam s proposal any adult tennessee resident without a college degree or certificate could use the scholarship regardless of income or past academic performance while college leaders suggested they would focus their recruiting efforts on the more than tennesseans with some college credit but no degree adults who had never stepped foot on a college campus would be eligible as well no caps no first come first served haslam said just as we did with tennessee promise we re making a clear statement to families with reconnect wherever you might fall on life s path education beyond high school is critical to the tennessee we can be we don t want cost to be an obstacle anyone has to overcome as they pursue their own generational change for themselves and their families state funding already covers tuition for adults who want to go to technical college and there is a small program that pays community college tuition for adults who meet a rigorous slate of requirements but officials expect the new community college scholarship which will allow adults to attend college part time to be a more popular option funding for the new scholarship would come from the state s lottery proceeds state dollars would be used to cover tuition only after all available federal aid was applied a last dollar model similar to tennessee promise officials expect the reconnect scholarship would cost the state million annually david gregory the interim chancellor of the tennessee board of regents college system said the reconnect scholarship would be a boon to the state s network of community colleges which have struggled to boost adult enrollment even as the promise scholarship led to a surge in teenage students this is a great time to continue the momentum that i feel like tennessee has got right now he said gregory said that to accommodate students who might be juggling coursework with a job and a family colleges would need to enhance their efforts by considering night classes weekend schedules and other nontraditional adjustments read more haslam pushes gas tax plan in state of the state address haslam unveils budget proposal million for employee and teacher raises haslam to boost fund for gatlinburg wildfire recovery things to watch as lawmakers return to nashville haslam plan calls for cent gas tax hike cuts to grocery sales tax how gov bill haslam put together his gas tax plan haslam has become one of the nation s most outspoken advocates for college access since launching the drive to initiative in more than a dozen programs including the promise and reconnect scholarships have been launched under that umbrella all with the goal of getting percent of working age tennesseans to complete a college education by to reach that goal the state said additional tennesseans would need to earn a degree or certificate but only high school students are expected to graduate in the next eight years meaning the state will need to draw at least adults onto campus and then graduation in a speech that haslam acknowledged was stuffed with numbers it was that prospect that drew emotion from the governor haslam told the audience he focused so heavily on higher education because he knew first hand it had the power to change lives the governor told lawmakers about his father jim haslam who was in the audience who was able to attend college because of a scholarship jim haslam went on to start the massively successful pilot corp because his father was the first in his family to attend college and get his degree the governor said the trajectory of his life and mine was changed

europe is guaranteeing citizens the right to repair roman hottgenroth is surrounded by lamps dishwashers and vacuum cleaners computers smartphones and tv receivers are piled high on tin shelves behind him a group of washing machines rattles loudly in test mode only somewhat drowned out by the bass thumping from a hi fi system an employee is checking none of these products work properly and that s the point here at stilbruch the department store in hamburg germany run by the city s sanitation department only goods that others have thrown away are offered up for sale but before they are sold they are checked and if necessary repaired in hottgenroth s square foot workshop the process is something of a dying art unfortunately repair is no longer intended for most appliances says hottgenroth stilbruch s operations manager but that may be changing across europe legislation is pushing back against a waste based economy and restoring for citizens something companies have gradually taken away the right to repair what they ve bought electronic components await inspection and possible repair at the stilbruch workshop photo courtesy hamburg sanitation department fix it or forget it hottgenroth sees every day how many appliances end up in the trash although often all they need is a fresh battery or receiver spare parts are hard to come by and all the components are soldered glued or riveted he says this is why while his employees can fix many products many others are unsalvageable because of their design devices often break just when you try to open them in addition there is usually no longer any provision for upgrading and adapting devices to new technical standards this should be banned hottgenroth says flatly some political leaders agree in november the eu parliament called on the european commission to make routine repair of everyday products easier systematic and cost efficient it said that warranties should be extended and that replacement parts should be improved and made more accessible as should information enabling general repair and maintenance the eu s existing eco design regulations could be an instrument to reach these goals these mandates were established years ago to improve the energy efficiency of products sold in the eu but in march the first eco design regulation that will define standards for repair and useful life will come into force manufacturers of washing machines dishwashers refrigerators and monitors will have to ensure that components are replaceable with common tools instruction manuals must be accessible to specialist companies and producers must supply spare parts within days cell phones computers and tablets however have not yet been regulated by an eu eco design directive and constitute some of the most harmful consumer waste to this end individual member states have moved ahead with their own regulations this month france will introduce an anti waste law with a repair index a grade of one through ten will appear on the labels of washing machines laptops smartphones tvs and lawn mowers this score will be calculated based on criteria such as ease of disassembly access to repair information and price and availability of spare parts the french government is also promoting modular product design and is aiming to have percent of electronic equipment in france be repairable by europe is one of the largest markets in the world which means that new eu design guidelines and right to repair mandates could force manufacturers across the world to make more durable products the shift can t come soon enough at over ten million tons per year e waste is the fastest growing waste stream in europe in germany alone two million tons are generated annually repairing products and extending their useful life could play a key role in mitigating the environmental consequences of all this waste and that s exactly what a large majority of eu citizens want nearly percent would rather repair their devices than replace them and a majority think that manufacturers should be legally obliged to facilitate the repair of digital devices or the replacement of their individual parts such products have existed for some time companies like fairphone and shiftphone produce sustainable repairable smartphones for instance but with the eu s new legislative mandates on the horizon bigger players are getting ahead of the game apple has launched a repair program for independent businesses in which companies can get apple parts tools training service guides diagnostics and resources to perform a variety of out of warranty repairs last year the german outdoor gear company vaude began providing customers with an index showing how repairable each of its products are electrolux a leading manufacturer of electrical appliances in europe has been preparing for the directive and will be ready to comply once it takes effect in march we will now ensure that the specific parts according to the legislation will be available directly to consumers says viktor sundberg vice president of european environmental affairs at electrolux and we will make the repair information available to independent repairers for the categories requested is that sufficient for dorothea kessler of ifixit europe the eu parliament has indeed sent a strong signal that the continent must embrace a more sustainable circular economy but it s only a start we will certainly have to wait a few more years for feasible measures to emerge for the most important product categories she says in the process she believes it won t be easy for the eu to stand up to the manufacturers lobbies consumer and environmental organizations have also welcomed the eu parliament resolution with cautious optimism the right to repair was already in the green deal of december as a buzzword says elke salzmann of the federation of consumer organizations in germany referring to europe s commitment to become the first climate neutral continent but we have to take care that the promise will be obliging in the meantime ifixit has been assigning a repairability rating to every new device on the market for years and provides free step by step instructions for do it yourself repairs in languages for products its online forum allows users to exchange ideas with other tinkerers the online community founded in california now has three million monthly users in europe and ten million worldwide to kessler it s a movement that has as much to do with altering mindsets as fixing gadgets our philosophy

peanut allergy cured in majority of children in immunotherapy trial australian researchers have made a breakthrough in the treatment of peanut allergy in children a small clinical trial conducted at the murdoch children s research institute has led to two thirds of children treated with an experimental immunotherapy treatment being cured of their allergy importantly this desensitisation to peanuts persisted for up to four years after treatment these children had been eating peanut freely in their diet without having to follow any particular program of peanut intake in the years after treatment was completed said the lead researcher prof mimi tang peanut allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis a life threatening allergic reaction and one of the most common causes of death from food allergy to combat this tang an immunologist and allergist pioneered a new form of treatment that combines a probiotic with peanut oral immunotherapy known as ppoit instead of avoiding the allergen the treatment is designed to reprogram the immune system s response to peanuts and eventually develop a tolerance it s thought that combining the probiotic with the immunotherapy gives the immune system the nudge it needs to do this according to tang forty eight children were enrolled in the ppoit trial and were randomly given either a combination of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus with peanut protein in increasing amounts or a placebo once daily for months at the end of the original trial in of children who received the immunotherapy treatment were deemed tolerant to peanuts compared with just in the placebo group four years later the majority of the children who gained initial tolerance were still eating peanuts as part of their normal diet and passed a further challenge test to confirm long term tolerance tang said the results were exciting and had been life changing for participants the way i see it is that we had children who came into the study allergic to peanuts having to avoid peanuts in their diet being very vigilant around that carrying a lot of anxiety with that and at the end of treatment and even four years later many of these children who had benefited from our probiotic peanut therapy could now live like a child who didn t have peanut allergy the results are published in the lancet child adolescent health if confirmed by larger clinical studies the broader hope is that this treatment can have an impact on the high rates of food allergy among children this is a major step forward in identifying an effective treatment to address the food allergy problem in western societies tang said,pos

fungi that eat radiation are growing on the walls of chernobyl s ruined nuclear reactor back in scientists were amazed when they made the discovery in the eerie environment inside the abandoned chernobyl nuclear power plant researchers remotely piloting robots spotted pitch black fungi growing on the walls of the decimated no nuclear reactor and even apparently breaking down radioactive graphite from the core itself what s more the fungi seemed to be growing towards sources of radiation as if the microbes were attracted to them more than a decade later university of saskatchewan professor ekaterina dadachova then at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york and her colleagues acquired some of the fungi and found that they grew faster in the presence of radiation compared to other fungi the three species tested cladosporium sphaerospermum cryptococcus neoformans and wangiella dermatitidis all had large amounts of the pigment melanin which is found among many places in the skin of humans people with a darker skin tone have much more of it melanin is known to absorb light and dissipate ultraviolet radiation but in the fungi it seemed to also be absorbing radiation and converting it into chemical energy for growth perhaps in a similar fashion to how plants utilize the green pigment chlorophyll to attain energy from photosynthesis this photomicrograph depicts cryptococcus neoformans using a light india ink staining preparation to learn more about chernobyl s radiation loving fungi jet propulsion laboratory researchers sent eight species collected from the area to the international space station iss back in seeking to observe how the organisms would react the iss environment exposes inhabitants to between and times more radiation than on earth researchers behind the effort hoped that the fungi would produce molecules that could be adapted into drugs that could be given to astronauts to protect them from radiation on long term missions results of the experiment have yet to be published back on earth dadachova noted in a paper that chernobyl s radiation loving fungi are almost certainly not the first examples of their kind large quantities of highly melanized fungal spores have been found in early cretaceous period deposits when many species of animals and plants died out this period coincides with earth s crossing the magnetic zero resulting in the loss of its shield against cosmic radiation this raises an intriguing possibility perhaps there are places in the cosmos where melanin containing organisms thrive in environments awash in radiation wherever there is energy to be harvested life might just find a way,pos

why is mister rogers making adults cry decades later if people are crying this much watching fewer than three minutes of won t you be my neighbor watch out for the waterworks when the full documentary opens thursday with a block party at tampa theatre and in limited release around the united states oscar winning director morgan neville s film about fred rogers beloved host of pbs kids show mister rogers neighborhood from to has picked up good reviews at festival screenings but from the moment the first trailer went online in march many who watched it did so through teary eyes the film covers rogers decades long mission to make television a tool for helping children stressing love community and acceptance he refused to talk down to kids when making episodes on divorce death and even assassination in the wake of robert kennedy s death but why all the crying it s not like we haven t had time to mourn the loss of the sweatered one who died in at adults did take it hard at the time though bonnie smalley of boulder colo remembers it being her freshman year at west chester university in pennsylvania when my dorm got notice that he died we all gathered in the common area and put on old episodes someone had taped on vhs she said it was definitely a group therapy type deal the sight of something from your childhood can make you emotional but rogers seems to cut deeper and across a wide range of people his show produced in pittsburgh was viewed by a whopping percent of u s households at its peak in according to pittsburgh magazine we tracked down people from around the country including those who commented on youtube twitter or reddit that the trailer made them cry fifteen years after rogers death we asked what he meant to them dunn was in army ranger school away from any phones or tvs but the instructor came into the barracks and announced mister rogers died today someone in the corner laughed and started retelling the untrue urban legend that rogers was a marine sniper who d had kills the rest of the barracks immediately shut the man down and fell completely silent in respect he remembers a couple of guys going into the latrine and coming back with bloodshot eyes fifteen years later i cried when i watched the trailer dunn said more people should for him rogers was a father figure in a home without one a peaceful man in times that weren t so peaceful and someone who treated kids with respect which sometimes was in short supply witecki is marketing and communications director for tampa theatre one of a handful of theaters premiering the film this week i ve watched the trailer several times now and get emotional every time i ve been trying to pinpoint why had you asked before i knew we were getting the movie what i remembered about mister rogers i would have mentioned the land of make believe the trolley him putting on his sneakers watching it now i realize the lasting impact has nothing to do with those little details and everything to do with growing up learning from that show to love yourself love your neighbor and learning that it s okay to be sad or angry and feel those emotions i think maybe it just really hits me that in today s climate of divisiveness and now that i have a year old daughter i wonder who is that mister rogers now who s the person today filling that role for children the online community the church of rogers jokingly describes itself as followers of rogerism who believe that mister rogers is a holy figure in reality it s just a tongue in cheek name but poag said there s a grain of truth in it i don t think there s a word in the english language for that feeling he said when asked why rogers makes people cry he theorized it has something to do with realizing you re an adult but have failed to live the neighborhood ideals that you ve somehow let your neighborhood down in mister rogers we can see virtue we can even feel it but we just can t seem to get there ourselves the state you re in mister rogers found his calling in florida williams said her parents were mostly absent and abusive and that mister rogers was a surrogate parent for her as i m sure he was with many others her world was filled with chaos but the world where rogers came in every day and changed from his suit to a cardigan and sneakers provided a little stability i promised myself if i ever had children of my own i would parent them in a way where they would feel the same way mister rogers made me feel safe and worthy and joyful i did that i have two beautiful children who are funny and awesome i broke the cycle of generational abuse in no small part due to mister rogers i genuinely feel if he were alive today he would be really proud of me for that the high school english teacher who straight up sobbed during the trailer said she grew up in louisiana exposed to bigotry hatred and racism mister rogers was revolutionary for her with his sensitivity acceptance and songs like it s you i like i remember one thing that always blew my mind was that he never yelled men in my life were always yelling and so to me mister rogers seemed like magic now in the classroom she chooses texts that will inspire empathy and guides her students to reflect on their feelings trying to teach kindness to kids is so radical and scary and infuriating and difficult but mister rogers showed that it s possible and i think he would be proud of me long author of s peaceful neighbor discovering the countercultural mister rogers calls rogers a radical for teaching pacifism while the united states was at war using the show to break down gender norms and racial barriers and for rogers vegetarianism on moral grounds maybe the emotional reaction has something to with living in a time when things feel so chaotic and technology spreads our attention thin he said that watching mister rogers neighborhood while researching the book made him totally present in the moment rogers had a gift for slowing the clock demanding us to be here and now for quieting the noise of our everyday lives rogers was an ordained presbyterian minister but in some ways it seems as if rogers sought to transform us into zen

he spent years wrongly convicted of murder he wants to spend the rest encouraging inmates to read cnn the first book john bunn fell in love with curled up in his cell at a maximum security prison in upstate new york was sister souljah s novel the coldest winter ever in the book a maternal woman advocates for the improvement of her black community in brooklyn as she watches the people she loves suffer from the consequences of incarceration violence and a seemingly endless cycle of poverty i related to that book on so many levels bunn says john bunn outside the kingsborough projects in crown heights brooklyn where robert crosson and rolando neischer were carjacked and shot in august of bunn knows more than most what it s like to face injustice arrested and imprisoned as an adolescent in new york city he spent years in jail for a crime he didn t commit and a further decade on parole fighting for his exoneration in that time he battled among others the courts police investigators ptsd and the challenges of illiteracy he was before he could read and write today bunn is and a free man at last mentoring at risk young people and advocating for the power of reading through his own program that brings books to prisons in many ways his own story sounds straight out of a sister souljah book except that bunn who survived years of wrongful incarceration with his humanity intact is determined to write the next chapter himself the arrest bunn s ordeal began on august when he was sitting in the kitchen of his mother s apartment in crown heights brooklyn it was degrees in the shade and the ac was broken outside he could hear hip hop music playing from passing cars and the thwack of basketballs on pavement as kids made their way to the courts bunn s mother maureen was making pancakes his two year old sister india cooing in her high chair bunn years old and out of school for the summer was ready for a typical day of playing ball and demonstrating his famous back flips in and around the four block radius between the apartment on ralph street his mom and the house on st marks his grandma those four blocks snug between the love of the two women who raised him were his whole world john bunn at home in crown heights brooklyn but then a bang on the door it was the police they wanted to take me down to the police station for questioning bunn recalls now sitting in that same small apartment festooned with family photos nearly three decades later he was taken to brooklyn s th precinct put in a room and handcuffed to a pole the interrogation was led by a detective by the name of louis scarcella and he was threatening me telling me that i was never coming home if i wouldn t tell him what he wanted to know he also told me that they already had beat up my co defendant that they had slammed his head into a wall and they already had him he recalls the co defendant a year old brooklyn boy named rosean hargrave bunn knew hargrave from the block although he and the older boy were never more than acquaintances but as he soon found out they were both now suspected of the same crime the killing of an off duty rikers island corrections officer named rolando neischer i kept telling them no i didn t have any knowledge of it bunn recalls john bunn right and rosean hargrove arrested at the th precinct in brooklyn in august nypd detective louis scarcella open jacket and loose tie holds bunn but detective scarcella who worked in the brooklyn north homicide unit for years before retiring in told the young john he did not believe him bunn s eyes fill with tears as he describes the moment he was placed in a police lineup with grown men as an adult bunn a slight man with a gentle disposition and a shy smile stands only feet inches at he estimates he was no taller than foot he was so much smaller than the adults he was lined up with that the detectives had to improvise they brought in stools so the lineup could be done sitting down bunn did what he was told he sat down and held up a number a couple of minutes later scarcella came back into the room he told me it was my lucky day that i got picked bunn says grimacing ever since then i ve been fighting to prove my innocence he says wiping his face and adjusting his hat on the front of his baseball cap in bold white letters are the words wrongfully convicted on the side victims of detective louis scarcella the hat he adds speaks for itself the night of the killing the day before bunn was arrested two off duty rikers island correction officers and old friends rolando neischer and robert crosson were sitting in a car chatting outside the kingsborough projects a housing project in crown heights it was about a m suddenly two men on bicycles approached the car pointed guns and ordered the pair out of their vehicle crosson later described at trial how a gun then went off the bullet ripping through his hand he managed to get out of the car and sprinted away losing track of his friend at some point neischer had grabbed his own firearm and fought back in the ensuing gunfight before the attackers jumped in the car and drove away neischer was shot five times he was found slumped against a fence bleeding but still alive feet from where the car had been parked the next day they came for john bunn with crosson identifying both him and hargrave in police lineups three days after that neischer died from his wounds on the night neischer and crosson were carjacked bunn had no inkling of what was to come but his mother heard a portent at about a m maureen bunn awoke from a deep sleep to the sound of gunshots they sounded like they were coming from the backyard of her housing complex near kingsborough i thought oh my god i hope everybody s ok she says recalling the incident years later instinctively she padded to her children s room peering into the dark to check on them minutes after the bullets that killed neischer tracked their fatal course through the soupy august air that night maureen noted with relief that her kids were safe john lay sound asleep in his bunk the trial on august bunn was formally charged with robbery and murder he was sent to the notorious spofford juvenile detention center in the bronx a vermin infested concrete building that was shut down in after allegations of violence and abuse there he waited for months spofford was one of the most violent places i ever experienced bunn says the staff members were very abusive it was like gladiator school you had to fight maybe three or four times a day what s more there was a target on his back because he had been charged with killing a corrections officer the months rolled by as he waited for trial his th birthday came and went an increasingly depressed and scared bunn didn t tell anyone about it a photo of the bridges juvenile center where john bunn spent nearly a year and a half awaiting trial things like birthdays stopped existing to me he says time stopped in there still bunn and his mother believed the trial would show he was not neischer s killer among other factors crosson the sole witness to the crime had described the carjackers as being light skinned men in their s s john was darker skinned and a short slight framed teenager bunn and hargrave s trial took place in november of on thanksgiving eve detective scarcella had testified in pre trial hearings but on the day of the trial itself just four people took the stand the first police officer to arrive at the scene the medical examiner a th precinct detective and crosson the sole primary witness who had picked both boys out of lineups the trial lasted just one day bunn and hargrave were both found guilty brooklyn detectives louis n scarcella left and stephen w chmil at the brooklyn d a office on april the truth didn t prevail it didn t come out my side of the story never came out either i never got a chance to have a voice i never got a chance to say anything bunn says bunn was sentenced to years to life though it was later reduced to nine years to life after lawyers successfully argued that he had been illegally charged as an adult hargrave received a sentence of years to life when maureen bunn heard the word life she had to be rushed to the hospital they said i had a mild heart attack i couldn t breathe i don t even remember when the ambulance came i went into another world it was just disbelief she says both bunn and hargrave filed appeals which were denied imprisonment after being found guilty bunn was immediately taken to a youth facility upstate maureen visited as much as she could spending all her money on long bus rides upstate as the household bills and eviction notices stacked up but john was isolated physically and mentally for a long time he had hidden a secret he had never learned to read or write i was further away from my family i wanted to communicate with my mother because i felt like me and her didn t have the best relationship and i was out there and i just wanted to tell her how i felt and that motivated me he says determined to be able to write letters to his mom bunn started with dictionaries and children s books working with teachers on how to sound words out letter by letter it was humbling at first but he learned fast and as he got the hang of it he says it did something for my self esteem and my imagination by the time he was bunn had his ged and was reading anything he could get his hands on from the prison library but turning also marked a more sobering milestone he would soon be eligible to be transferred to an adult facility photos of john bunn during his time in jail line the walls at the home of his mother maureen i got my ged and i graduated to state prison says bunn adding that he remembers the bus journey to the adult facility as one of the scariest feelings i ever experienced you hear all of the stories about how people get raped and there s knives and there s razors but all along that bus ride i went from being fearful and intimidated to suddenly me becoming aggressive because i felt like i had to be aggressive in order for them not to take advantage of me he says bunn noticed that increasingly he was finding his anger hard to control i became institutionalized to the point where i start letting that experience make me angry i started being bitter in there and started getting into violent situations the elmira correctional facility in elmira new york where john did much of his reading through it all one thing kept him level headed to those in the prison he may have been john bunn inmate number q brooklyn boy corrections officer killer but with a book in his hand lying in his bunk on g block at elmira correctional facility an imposing victorian building that sits high on a hill in upstate new york bunn felt free in the daytime he began taking anger management classes passing them with such flying colors that he became a qualified anger management counselor himself running his own program for inmates at night he would return to his cell where he would read slowly so he had something to look forward to savoring each word amidst the familiar soundtrack of the prison at night the hum of radios all softly playing different stations the monologues of top dog inmates holding court for minutes at a time as others kept a respectful silence and the ever present clang of the gates that slammed and opened slammed and opened signaling the night and heralding the morning john his mother maureen and sister india during a family visit at elmira i wrote my mother one day and i said they can lock my body but they can t trap my mind bunn says the power of reading made me feel that way i felt trapped without a voice for so long but the power of reading could take my imagination and take me to anywhere in this universe in bunn saved a prison counselor from being violently assaulted and raped by another inmate his heroic actions were a factor in the parole board s decision to release him that year bunn walked out of elmira wearing a shirt shorts and a pair of timberland boots bought for him by his family and with his of gate money earned from his a week prison salary in his pocket when i got in the lobby my brother and cousin were there once i got to them i felt safe he says it was the first time i felt like i was safe again in years exoneration but out on parole bunn struggled with his criminal record as a convicted murderer he couldn t get a job he was diagnosed with ptsd and was granted social security and disability then in after struggling with depression he failed to report for a parole meeting and was sent back to jail he returned to prison for another year and released in i wasn t able to adjust after being alone and gone for so long he says bunn s prison identification card but bunn was about to get some long awaited good news in the exoneration initiative a nonprofit organization that provides free legal assistance to the wrongfully convicted in new york began looking into bunn s and hargrave s convictions hargrave had not been granted parole and remained behind bars and on top of that many of detective sarcella s convictions from the s and s were beginning to crumble one by one in april came a breakthrough a new motion was filed by rosean hargrave s legal team to vacate the charges the pattern and practice of scarcella s conduct which manifest a disregard for rules law and the truth undermines our judicial system and gives cause for a new review of the evidence declared the judge in the case justice shawndya simpson judge simpson overturned rosean hargrave s convictions and ordered a new trial after years in prison hargrave was released on bond pending retrial a year later after a similar motion was filed on john bunn s behalf by the exoneration initiative his own day in court came in her ruling judge simpson called the evidence used to convict bunn paltry and slammed what she called scarcella s disregard for rules law and truth in may of after years of wrongful conviction the district attorney s office announced they would not retry rosean hargrave or john bunn they became the th and th men to be exonerated of convictions related to investigations by detective louis scarcella after judge simpson announced he was a free man bunn addressed the courtroom i am an innocent man your honor and i have always been an innocent man he said tears streaming down his face as his mother maureen audibly gulped back sobs john bunn holds hands with judge shawndya simpson at the hearing where he was exonerated after years to date of detective scarcella s cases from the s and s have been flagged for review and at least of scarcella s homicide convictions have been overturned because of tainted evidence misleading testimony or forced confessions according to the brooklyn district attorney s office but it s unlikely that scarcella will face any consequences he has never been charged with a crime according to the da prosecutors have not found any laws that can be prosecuted today the statute of limitations has expired for any potential criminal offenses cnn s attempts to reach detective scarcella were not successful but he told the daily news in that he had done absolutely nothing wrong scarcella remains in new york city living on staten island he still collects a full nypd

german parliament votes to legalise same sex marriage german mps have voted in favour of legalising same sex marriage prompting joyous and unusual scenes in parliament as green party politicians tossed glittered confetti across the chamber and gay couples sitting in the public gallery kissed and embraced the vote by to with four abstentions followed minutes of often heated and highly emotional debate reflecting a wider decades long argument over marriage equality the german chancellor angela merkel voted against the move despite having paved the way for the law s passage by inviting mps to vote according to their conscience merkel had appeared to shift her longstanding opposition to gay marriage on monday when she said that she considered the values lived out in a same sex partnership equal to those in a heterosexual marriage after dropping a red no card into the ballot box in the bundestag she explained for me marriage as defined by law is marriage between a man and a woman it was a long intensive and for many also emotional discussion that goes for me personally too and i m hopeful not only that there will be respect for either side s opinions but that it will also bring about more peace and cohesion in society she said german parliamentarians vote to put the law on legalising same sex marriage on the agenda photograph fabrizio bensch reuters since same sex couples in germany have been able to enter into civil unions but not to marry under the new law which is expected to take effect before the end of the year married same sex couples will also be able to adopt children together the vote marked a stunning farewell victory for the green politician volker beck a veteran gay rights campaigner who was ending a year career as a lawmaker yesterday today a bastion has fallen he told the german news agency dpa the lesbian and gay association which has pushed for the reform since greeted the outcome declaring that germany has voted for love this is a historic day it said in a statement not only for lesbians and gays but also for a more just and democratic society it remains something of a mystery as to whether merkel is a canny operator who had meant to trigger the vote all along or whether she was as much as anyone else in the bundestag taken by surprise that it had happened what is clear is that she will now be able to take credit for having triggered the vote despite the fact she and her alliance have been opposing moves towards marriage equality for decades merkel has also effectively taken the wind out of the sails of her junior coalition partners the social democrats spd who have treated gay marriage as a key campaigning issue in the runup to elections in september some within the ranks of merkel s own christian democratic union cdu party were furious about having been bulldozed into a vote at short notice although she will feel that she can hold her head high with disaffected colleagues because of her no vote merkel faced a barrage of criticism from within the chamber with the sharpest rebuke coming from the spd s johannes kahrs who accused her of having stood in the way of the law for years in all honesty frau merkel thanks for nothing he said the vote was set in motion during an audience with merkel at berlin s maxim gorki theatre on monday evening hosted by the women s magazine brigitte merkel held court on the issue of marriage equality for eight minutes towards the end of the question and answer session after ulli k ppe a journalist and events manager who was sitting in the audience asked her when will i be able to call my boyfriend my husband merkel responded pensively saying she had given the issue much thought and had come to the conclusion that a same sex partnership could be considered just as valuable as a heterosexual one but she believed that for those who are religious the question was more complicated and ultimately down to an individual s conscience she went on to describe a life changing experience she had had after meeting a lesbian couple in her home constituency on germany s baltic coast she told the pair that her personal sticking point over same sex marriage was the issue of children s welfare gundula zilm who has been in a relationship for years with her partner christine with whom she cares for five foster children invited merkel to visit her at home to see how well her children were doing merkel said the encounter had led to a change of heart because authorities clearly had confidence in the couple s ability to care for the children if the state deems a child to be better off in a same sex partnership than living in a household with a man and woman where violence is the norm then i must recognise this and take it into consideration when making a

saving the world one banana leaf at a time a supermarket in thailand garnered attention from the netizens around the world for the implementation of its store policy which replaces plastic packaging in all of its produce with banana leaf wrappings a world wrapped in plastic we have slowly become engrossed with the use of plastic packaging in almost everything that we buy when we walk into a supermarket the most common sight we see are products wrapped in plastic even fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables are now already sold inside this ubiquitous form of wrapping we might very well disregard this issue altogether however sooner than later we might find ourselves living in an ocean full of plastics sad to say we don t have to contemplate on how this could severely affect our environment it s already happening and unless you purposely shut yourself from hearing the latest news we always often hear cases of marine life being threatened by the overflowing plastic waste in the sea studies even show that in a matter of years more than billion tonnes of plastic will completely cover the oceans and fill our landfills a green initiative but apparently all hope is not lost as some of us still have the heart to change for the better the rimping supermarket in chiangmai thailand for example is strongly implementing a no plastic packaging policy in every fresh produce being sold instead the store uses banana leaves the pictures posted on facebook by a chiang mai based real estate company perfect homes show rimping s banana leaf packaging in action the simple yet highly relevant innovation is used to hold together bushels of spring onions bunch of chillies and peppers and clumps of leafy vegetables with the help of what appears to be strings made from the hard and flexible part of banana trunk everything is tied together neatly in place one can still notice the use of plastic in its labeling however the primary use of leaves significantly reduces the need to do it with plastic as such this store policy can be seen as a huge step for a greener plastic free earth a sustainable alternative interestingly the use of banana leaves for packing and preserving food has been a tradition being practiced not only in most asian nations as it is also prevalent in polynesian countries like in guam or hawaii it is also being done in mexico and jamaica in thailand the rimping supermarket in chiangmai is considered as one of the first to employ the method on a large commercial scale while bananas can grow in most regions that have humid tropical climates asia is blessed with multiple varieties of this plant some types can survive with minimal care while others have the characteristics to grow very rapidly in just a matter of months in thailand for example they have different varieties of bananas even if the country decides to implement this innovation on a nation wide scale this resource is still believed to be sustainable and would be difficult to deplete adapting in a global scale we might wonder can this method be applied globally we can certainly hope so there could be problems with this approach especially in western countries where banana fruits have to be exported let alone the leaves these materials despite its nature friendly properties aren t as readily available as compared to here in asia but then rimping supermarket s initiative should serve as an inspiration for everyone around the world to get creative and come up with alternative ways to help save our environment,pos

satellite shows high productivity from u s corn belt image data from satellite sensors show that during the northern hemisphere s growing season the midwest region of the united states boasts more photosynthetic activity than any other spot on earth according to nasa and university scientists healthy plants convert light to energy via photosynthesis but chlorophyll also emits a fraction of absorbed light as fluorescent glow that is invisible to the naked eye the magnitude of the glow is an excellent indicator of the amount of photosynthesis or gross productivity of plants in a given region research in led by joanna joiner of nasa s goddard space flight center in greenbelt md demonstrated that fluorescence from plants could be teased out of data from existing satellites which were designed and built for other purposes the new research led by luis guanter of the freie universit t berlin used the data for the first time to estimate photosynthesis from agriculture results were published march in proceedings of the national academy of sciences according to co author christian frankenberg of nasa s jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif the paper shows that fluorescence is a much better proxy for agricultural productivity than anything we ve had before this can go a long way regarding monitoring and maybe even predicting regional crop yields image guanter joiner and frankenberg launched their collaboration at a workshop hosted by the keck institute for space studies at the california institute of technology in pasadena to explore measurements of photosynthesis from space the team noticed that on an annual basis the tropics are the most productive but during the northern hemisphere s growing season the u s corn belt really stands out frankenberg said areas all over the world are not as productive as this area the researchers set out to describe the phenomenon observed by carefully interpreting the data from the global ozone monitoring experiment gome on metop a a european meteorological satellite data showed that fluorescence from the corn belt which extends from ohio to nebraska and kansas peaks in july at levels percent greater than those observed in the amazon comparison with ground based measurements from carbon flux towers and yield statistics confirmed the results the match between ground based measurements and satellite measurements was a pleasant surprise said joiner a co author on the paper ground based measurements have a resolution of about square miles square kilometer while the satellite measurements currently have a resolution of more than square miles square kilometers the study confirms that even with coarse resolution the satellite method could estimate the photosynthetic activity occurring inside plants at the molecular level for areas with relatively homogenous vegetation like the corn belt image challenges remain in estimating the productivity of fragmented agricultural areas not properly sampled by current space borne instruments that s where missions with better resolution could help such as nasa s orbiting carbon observatory a mission planned for launch in july that will also measure solar induced fluorescence the research could also help scientists improve the computer models that simulate earth s carbon cycle as guanter found a strong underestimation of crop photosynthesis in models the analysis revealed that carbon cycle models which scientists use to understand how carbon cycles through the ocean land and atmosphere over time underestimate the productivity of the corn belt by to percent unlike most vegetation food crops are managed to maximize productivity they usually have access to abundant nutrients and are irrigated the corn belt for example receives water from the mississippi river accounting for irrigation is currently a challenge for models which is one reason why they underestimate agricultural productivity if we don t take into account irrigation and other human influences in the agricultural areas we re not going to correctly estimate the amount of carbon taken up by vegetation particularly corn joiner said corn plants are very productive in terms of assimilating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere this needs to be accounted for going forward in trying to predict how much of the atmospheric carbon dioxide will be taken up by crops in a changing climate according to frankenberg the remote sensing based techniques now available could be a powerful monitoring tool for food security especially data from oco and in combination with data from other upcoming satellites such as nasa s soil moisture active passive scheduled for launch later this year nasa monitors earth s vital signs from land air and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground based observation campaigns nasa develops new ways to observe and study earth s interconnected natural systems with long term data records and computer analysis tools to

canada just ruled to uphold net neutrality on thursday afternoon the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission crtc the country s federal telecom regulator dropped a bombshell ruling on the status of net neutrality the principle that all web services should be treated equally by providers and blessedly it s good news the crtc ruled that internet service providers should treat data traffic equally to foster consumer choice innovation and the free exchange of ideas a crtc news release states what this means is that service providers won t be able to privilege certain services over others say youtube or apple music by letting you use them without dinging your data plan this is a practice generally known as zero rating or differential pricing advertisement differential pricing contradicts the principle of net neutrality because it allows service providers to leverage their privileged position to decide which services are most attractive to their customers effectively discriminating against others the crtc s decision is welcome news as its sister organization in the us the federal communications commission fcc is right now starting to roll back some of its previous commitments to net neutrality the crtc ruling originated from complaints against quebec based provider videotron s unlimited music streaming service which launched in the service allowed subscribers to stream music from third party apps without it counting against their data plans those complaints sparked a series of hearings on the practice of differential pricing at the time of the hearings in the fall of last year two of canada s big three telecom providers came out in support of differential pricing telus and bell while rogers was the sole dissenting voice among the trio the crtc also ruled on the videotron case today and in line with its decision on net neutrality and its new framework for evaluating differential pricing schemes also published on thursday it ordered videotron to come into compliance with the law which is a nice way of saying it should stop offering its unlimited music service as it stands the company has yet to release a public statement responding to the order my friends it s a good day to be a hoser,pos
a support group in your phone healing for mental illness comes one text at a time johnny crowder used to have a negative outlook on the world he grew up in what he described as an abusive household he was diagnosed with a slew of mental illnesses during his formative years from bipolar disorder to obsessive compulsive disorder it was easy for him to feel down about himself i realized how i was thinking was contributing to my struggles said crowder a year old tampa native but i couldn t climb out of it so he started filling sticky notes with positive affirmative messages and leaving them around his house on one note he remembers penciling you deserve to spend time with people who care about you it made a difference for just a few seconds a day he d feel better but eventually the notes became commonplace and their effect seemed to wear off so he decided to try it another way this time by sending uplifting text messages to his friends to see how they reacted the first text i sent to about friends in my contacts with the same message nearly everyone responded he said they interpreted it differently based on their own lives but i was surprised to see so many of them replied with how did you know like i knew they were going through something that s how crowder founded cope notes it s a text messaging service aimed at those going through a difficult time every day a cope notes user will get a random message usually something uplifting but it could also be advice about an exercise to try or tips to boost positivity users are encouraged to text back and to use the thread as their own digital journal crowder said people would rather text their friends than talk to them about something difficult he said we wanted to create something that was optionally interactive some of the texts are prompts and while it s not necessarily a two way conversation we want the platform to foster independence the goal is not to be something people rely on forever related when suicide threats come calling i try to make a connection crowder s timing it seems is important depression diagnosis rates rose percent from to according to the blue cross blue shield association s health of america report children and millennials seem to be the most at risk with diagnosis rates spiking by percent and percent respectively over the same period women too seem to suffer from depression more often with diagnosis rates that are double those of men according to the blue cross report what s more the report said people with depression are nearly percent less healthy on average than those without it and percent also suffer from other chronic health conditions cope notes launched quietly nearly a year ago from crowder s south tampa home and now has about users crowder said they range in age from to he s the one writing the messages that are delivered each day but they are reviewed by a panel of mental health counselors and professors public relations professionals and privacy compliance officials the service costs a month or a month for an annual subscription there s also an option of a one week free trial a recent example of a cope notes message when you hold the door open for someone and they step on your foot you should still be proud their bad decision doesn t invalidate your good one another one said the entire world was changed by people just like you normal folks who didn t think they were just about to change the world don t underestimate yourself and this coloring for minutes can help clear your mind and soothe anxiety it may sound childish but how do you think adult coloring books became best sellers cope notes is not meant to replace therapy or clinical treatment but it can supplement it said kristin kosyluk an assistant professor in the department of mental health law policy at the university of south florida she said crowder and his text messaging platform are also good examples of where mental health care is headed we re moving toward a recovery model and away from a medical model kosyluk said it gives someone like johnny who has been through the system and has personal experience the authority and credibility to provide support to others kosyluk cited the alcoholics anonymous community where people who have suffered from the same afflictions comfort and support one another as a good example of a recovery model cope notes has that piece to it because johnny is open about his experiences she said a lot of times people are seeking help in a clinical setting and not finding support in their own communities a simple text message that somebody receives that s an intervention being delivered in the moment kosyluk is working with crowder to potentially collect research data from cope note users in the future also read pediatricians are the new allies in the battle against teen depression they can spot it early before becoming a mental health activist in speaking about his survival story to community groups and schools crowder tried just about anything that would help as he struggled with depression i tried meditation apps the tony robbins walk on coals type self help people you name it i was hungry for anything that would help me cope with what was happening to me but what bothered him most about the programs he tried were the promises of an overnight cure it takes a long time to feel better there s no flip of a switch in your brain that makes everything normal he said it takes a lot of tiny steps and nudges in the right direction over time to heal and come up with healthy coping practices

pupils suffering from anxiety and depression to receive counselling in schools children suffering from anxiety and depression will be offered counselling at school under government plans to tackle a widely reported crisis in young people s mental health pupils in england will be able to attend sessions with therapists at school or college in an attempt to stop any psychological difficulties deepening into lifelong issues every school will also be required to appoint a teacher to co ordinate improved support for the fast growing number of children who are struggling mentally many self harming as a result of bullying exam stress dissatisfaction with their body shape troubles at home and other factors the plans are included in a government green paper to be launched on sunday by health secretary jeremy hunt and education secretary justine greening a new guaranteed maximum four week waiting time for children with more complex problems to access nhs child and adolescent mental health services camhs will be phased in that is a response to concerns that many vulnerable under s including some who may be suicidal are being forced to wait for care or even denied help because camhs care is overloaded around half of all mental illness starts before the age of so it is vital that children get support as soon as they need it in the classroom if we catch mental illness early we can treat it and stop it turning into something more serious said hunt sarah brennan chief executive of the charity youngminds welcomed the plans we are facing a crisis in our classrooms and far too many children are not getting the support they need too often we hear from young people who have started to self harm become suicidal or dropped out of school while waiting for the right help she said the improvements will begin in and be backed by what the government says is m of new funding over several years which is on top of the bn the coalition government allocated to children s mental health up to the national association of head teachers which represents most primary school heads welcomed the four week camhs waiting time as an extremely important step forward under s are currently enduring waits of as long as months the nhs regulator said recently around m of the m will fund the creation of mental health support teams in schools ministers intend that several thousand new children and young people s wellness practitioners therapists providing mainly cognitive behaviour therapy will undertake most of the work with pupils but with school nurses and educational psychologists also involved ministers hope that this increase in early intervention will reduce the number of children who go on to struggle mentally as adults however the initiatives will initially be piloted to assess their effectiveness so the new forms of support envisaged will not be available across england until an unspecified time in the s the government s ambition is only that they have been put in place in a fifth of the country by dr bernadka dubicka a children s psychiatrist who chairs the royal college of psychiatrists child and adolescent faculty said she was frustrated that more help would not be put in place sooner while welcoming the four week treatment pledge she also queried where the extra mental health professionals would come from to provide speedier camhs care official figures show that the number of specialist children s psychiatrists working in the nhs in england has fallen since conservative mp sarah wollaston chair of the health select committee welcomed the announcement but said she was keen to see more details we need to have a much greater focus on early intervention and prevention any money going into that is a good thing she said she welcomed better coordination between schools and the nhs but said that some schools were already working well with the health service and others should learn the lessons from those places it s often down to resourcing she said most young people prefer to have these services delivered in a setting of school because it s much easier to access children don t necessarily want to feel stigmatised by a

this undersea robot just delivered baby corals to the great barrier reef with oceans growing warmer and more acidic as a result of climate change the world s coral reefs are under siege recent research shows that the number of coral bleaching events has risen drastically in recent years and in and about half of the coral making up australia s great barrier reef died off but researchers at two australian universities have developed an underwater robot that could help turn the tide in the ongoing struggle to save at risk reefs the briefcase size submersible dubbed larvalbot is designed to move autonomously along damaged sections of reef seeding them with hundreds of thousands of microscopic baby corals the reduced number of corals means we ve lost the ability for coral to provide enough larvae to settle and restore these communities quickly said peter harrison director of the marine ecology research centre at southern cross university and the leader of the coral restoration project the idea here is to use an automated technique that allows us to target delivery of the larvae into damaged reef systems and increase the efficiency that new coral communities can be generated harrison s team recently tested larvalbot at vlasoff reef an outer part of the great barrier reef along australia s northeastern coast in the trial run the submersible dispersed baby specimens derived from corals that survived the bleaching event of which are believed to be especially tolerant of warmer ocean temperatures future versions of the bot should be able to disperse millions of baby corals in order to speed the regrowth of damaged reefs harrison said adding that the team is also planning to test larvalbot on a reef in the philippines but the researchers will have to wait and see if the microscopic baby corals take hold we can t actually see the results of these experiments until we start to see juvenile corals grow so for at least six to nine months harrison said what we ll be doing now is monitoring the reef over the coming months larvalbot is based on another submersible robot known as rangerbot which was designed not to deliver babies but to kill a coral eating species of starfish rangerbot was developed and built by matthew dunbabin an engineering and robotics professor at queensland university of technology who also reworked the rangerbot to carry the baby corals harrison hopes to eventually develop a fleet of larvalbots that would be used to repopulate reefs around the world though he is unsure how much such a project would cost mark eakin the college park maryland based coordinator of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s coral reef watch program called harrison s project an excellent idea but questioned the effectiveness of underwater robots in tackling a global problem like coral loss the area of coral reefs hit by significant mortality is about the size of the state of west virginia eakin said now imagine dividing the state of west virginia across the entire pacific ocean we need to be doing everything we can to protect coral reefs but we have to keep in mind that this problem is absolutely huge compared to what these robots can do eakin said saving reefs will ultimately require addressing the root cause of the problem climate change even if this technology is scaled up if we don t deal with climate change it won t be enough he said it s like coming up with a robot to replant trees after the devastating wildfires that just happened it s not addressing how to stop the wildfires in the first place want more stories about the environment follow nbc news mach on twitter facebook and instagram,pos

coke and pepsi abandon the plastics lobby new york cnn business coca cola and pepsico two major sellers of plastic bottles have made sweeping sustainability commitments now they are stepping away from a plastics lobbying group both soft drink companies are trying to increase the amount of recycled plastic they use in bottles they want to improve recycling infrastructure and ensure their packages are recyclable but the plastics industry association has ties to the american progressive bag alliance which encourages states to make plastic bans illegal participation in the association could tarnish coca cola and pepsi s images as companies working to find solutions to plastic pollution the association took positions that were not fully consistent with our commitments and goals coca cola said in a statement last week noting that it withdrew from the group earlier this year pepsi said it had joined the association to learn about innovation as it works to achieve a circular economy for plastics we do not participate in the policy advocacy work of the association or its subsidiaries and our membership will conclude at the end of this year pepsi said coke and pepsi made the wrong choice by being a part of the lobbying organization said dianna cohen ceo of the nonprofit plastic pollution coalition the optics of membership she added are really bad plastic pollution is a major problem cutting ties with the plastic industry association is a sign that companies understand that they cannot publicly say they want to end plastic pollution while financially supporting an association that lobbies for our continued reliance on throwaway plastics said greenpeace usa oceans campaign director john hocevar in a statement the move may help reassure some customers but as people grow more worried about the negative impacts of plastic pollution on the environment as well as on animal and human health companies like pepsi and coke will have to go even further to find a solution tackling plastic pollution both companies are trying to figure out ways to reduce their use of virgin plastics and increase recycling they re also exploring alternatives to plastics like aluminum that are easier to recycle pepsico announced recently that its aquafina brand water will be sold in aluminum cans at us fast food and restaurant chains as soon as next year the company is testing out a broader rollout to retail stores tackling plastic waste is one of my top priorities and i take this challenge personally pepsico ceo ramon laguarta said at the time we are doing our part to address the issue head on by reducing recycling and reinventing our packaging pepsi has committed to using only recyclable compostable or biodegradable packaging by and it s pledged to make new plastic bottles using recycled material plus coca cola last year launched a world without waste initiative that encompasses its recycling goals which include collecting and recycling the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells by the company has also committed to making its bottles and cans out of at least recycled material in the next years the companies are also exploring refill stations that eliminate single use packaging altogether pepsi is selling a high tech water cooler that lets customers fill up their own bottles with flavored or unflavored still or carbonated water in varying temperatures coca cola has launched a similar product for dasani on college campuses leaving the lobby those initiatives made membership in the plastics trade group problematic at least from a pr standpoint the plastics industry association is not only a lobbying group some of its initiatives like helping recycling may overlap with those of coke and pepsi our members work together to align their efforts to put recycling and sustainability at the forefront of their businesses said patty long interim president and ceo of the plastics industry association in a statement the plastics association says it does not itself lobby for legislation that bans plastic or hold an official position on those laws it says that it operate separately from the bag alliance and has different memberships and dues but a page on the association s website redirects to the bag alliance site and the contact email for the bag alliance has the same suffix as the association s an association representative declined to share how the groups are connected activists started pressuring coke pepsi and other companies to leave the plastic association last year the shareholder activist group as you sow and walden asset management called attention last year to corporate involvement with the plastic industry association and wrote letters to the ceos of coca cola and pepsico among others this year greenpeace also drew a line between the plastic industry association and anti plastic ban laws the plastics association said greenpeace is responsible for companies withdrawal from the group we are aware that several prominent brands that are members of the association have been targeted by a persistent greenpeace activist campaign to pressure them to leave our association long said calling

the last of the whales have finally been freed from russia s notorious whale jail russia s notorious whale jail is no more following a huge international backlash the last of the belugas housed at the whale jail on russia s far east coast have been released into the wild according to a statement from the russian federal research institute of fisheries and oceanography vniro an estimated orcas and beluga whales were once held at the facility which consisted of cramped ice covered enclosures in a gloomy bay near the pacific port of nakhodka the situation first made headlines in november when conservationists shared drone footage of the whales enclosures video below the video quickly went viral sparking an international outcry from activists and even some high profile celebrities including leonardo dicaprio the russian government was relatively receptive to the criticism with president vladimir putin himself asking his government to investigate the whale enclosures following a lengthy investigation prosecutors eventually deemed the enclosures illegal and ordered the company to release the whales along with a fine of million rubles the whales have since been steadily released in several batches starting in early summer with the last of the orcas being freed in august on november authorities stated that the release of the last belugas into the bay of uspeniya had been completed successfully during transportation the animals behaved calmly their behavior was monitored by scientists veterinarians and experienced trainers vniro said in a statement three large individuals have satellite tags that will allow scientists to monitor the movement of animals in the wild however the move has received some criticism conservation group free russian whales notes that two of the belugas that were being transported currently remain unaccounted for the whale sanctuary project also argues that the choice of location the bay of uspeniya could put whales at risk of poaching and natural hazards this outcome is not ideal for the belugas since this is not their normal habitat or the area where they were captured jean michel cousteau and charles vinick of the whale sanctuary project said in a statement nonetheless we trust the intention of russian government authorities to release the belugas despite limitations due to the availability of ships inadequate finances and weather conditions we also hope that visual monitoring will help reduce concerns about threats from north korean fishing vessels that we understand are poaching in the area and that the russian government will do what is necessary to protect the belugas from repeat capture while the situation might not be ideal a worse fate was facing the captured orcas and belugas it s thought the animals were illegally caught last year to be sold to marine parks and aquariums in china where the captive orca park industry is booming,pos
crossroads church leverages donations to wipe out million in medical debt crossroads church senior pastor brian tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing he spent about three minutes describing the burden of medical debt during his nov sermon entitled the marks of multiplication tome said members of the congregation could text multiply to to help free others from medical debt but insisted the campaign was not a challenge just an awareness it was also a great metaphor for his lesson on multiplicity when we are in debt a sin debt to god we can t get our way out of the sin debt to god he said during the sermon jesus comes and gives himself so we can pay off our sin debt so we never have to worry about god hurting us for our sin crossroads could give to free others debt too he said and for every dollar they raised crossroad s partner rip medical debt would leverage that dollar to abolish in medical debt therefore multiplying the church s impact within a week and a half members of the crossroads community donated enough to abolish over million in medical debt nationwide over million of those funds came back to ohio families subscribe now for unlimited access to cincinnati com most of it probably that weekend said crossroads director of marketing brennan hill cause i think most people if i had to guess were doing it in real time you know if they were literally getting their phones out and texting in church officials announced the impact of their campaign sunday morning most of the funds came back to ohio families since the church is based out of the cincinnati region but the sermons are streamed online which means anyone in the nation can tune in and participate rip medical debt is able to track the donations back to their original zip codes to give back so if you donated from indiana your donation was multiplied and given back to your community in indiana in ohio church officials say they have abolished million in debts across households in zip codes they also abolished million in debt across kentucky households million across tennessee households and across indiana households what is rip medical debt an article posted by usa today last year explains that rip medical debt is a nonprofit organization based out of rye new york that arranges debt payoffs the article said medical debt contributes to two thirds of bankruptcies according to the american journal of public health and a kaiser family foundation new york times poll showed that of the percent of people who reported problems paying medical bills percent reported a major life impact such as taking an extra job cutting other household spending or using up savings how sad that probably the only debt that you don t choose to get cause you don t choose to get sick and it s the one that s affecting most people said victor martinez spiritual growth site leader for the oakley location when a person can t pay a bill that debt is often packaged with other people s debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill rip medical debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors but instead of collecting the debt rip forgives it to be eligible for repayment from rip the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level about a year for an individual and for a family of four have debts that are percent or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard to collect debts off their books they sell them cheap working this way puts a high dollar project within reach of even small churches revolution annapolis a nondenominational maryland church with sunday attendance of around and without a permanent building wiped out million in debt for families in march total amount raised a debt that never goes away even if you don t know about it according to the federal trade commission debt collectors have a certain number of years they can sue you and win to collect a debt this rule is called the statute of limitations and is six years in ohio this means that for any type of debt a creditor cannot sue a debtor for debt collection purposes after six years according to america s debt help organization that timeframe begins when someone fails to make a payment on a debt the clock will start again if you make a payment or provide written acknowledgment of your debt after the first six years are up martinez says that because of this law many people who got a letter explaining that their debt had been abolished thanks to crossroads didn t even know they had medical debt if it was after those six years hospitals and debt collectors had stopped calling if those six years pass then nobody can give you a call asking for that money martinez said but you still owe that money technically and the only way that you can really get rid of it is if you file bankruptcy or if you pay for it medical debt never goes away it will stay on your record if you don t pay it the law just states that if you don t pay it within that six year window people will stop asking you to pay not that you are off the hook martinez said that now that he understands how the law works he s afraid to call and ask if he owes anything because what if he owes a lot of money he ll be accountable to pay it he said that is very scary he said because what if i have medical debt that i don t know about a great analogy to what jesus did for us crossroads officials did not want this story to be about them we kept it off social media hill said we really want it to be about people in our community like i said who are currently giving crossroads members don t know who specifically they have impacted they could not choose whose debt to pay off in a letter to each debtor crossroads explained the campaign and said that they hope to provide more resources for those in need whether that is through prayer or connecting them with healthcare professionals in their community we don t want this to be the last interaction that we have with them but there are no strings attached hill said we just hope that they understand who crossroads is what our heart is for the community maybe set foot in one of our sites this whole experience has been a great analogy to what jesus did for us martinez said jesus before we knew who he was he died for us to forgive our debt martinez said and here we don t know who these people are and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven according to rip medical

how san francisco sends less trash to the landfill than any other major u s city the average american produces about pounds of waste per day roughly pounds of that is composted or recycled meaning the u s avoids sending just percent of its waste to landfills according to the epa san francisco provides a much different narrative thanks to bold public policy and educational initiatives the city diverts about percent of its waste from landfills or more than million tons every year ultimately san francisco aims to reach zero waste that means recycling composting reusing and reducing consumption so that nothing goes to either the landfill or incineration the city hopes to achieve this goal by but even if it doesn t san francisco is already way ahead of other cities for example new york only diverts about percent of its waste and chicago is at about percent how has san francisco done it in san francisco made recycling and composting a requirement for all businesses and residences it passed the nation s first mandatory composting law and while a few progressive cities have followed suite most haven t san francisco also banned environmentally hazardous items like checkout bags and styrofoam debbie raphael director of the san francisco department of the environment said she s proud of how the city has used market incentives to drive behavior if we can t ban the materials sometimes we ll put a charge on it she said we might ban a plastic bag and put a charge on using a single use paper bag because we re sending signals to the producers and to the users to the consumers that there s an easy convenient right way to do things to encourage behavior change san francisco initially set trash collection rates much higher than recycling and composting rates while rates are more comparable now residential bin sizes provide a behavioral nudge standard residential services include a gallon blue recycling bin a gallon green composting bin and gallon black trash bin businesses are also charged according to the volume of waste they present they receive discounts for using the green and blue bins and are penalized if recyclables or compostables end up in the trash another key to san francisco s success is its exclusive partnership with waste management company recology raphael said that working with one company eases the administrative burden and makes it possible to collaborate on long term goals new york by comparison has a private system for commercial waste comprised of hundreds of competing waste collection companies this makes it challenging for the local government to collaborate on citywide initiatives behind the scenes the final element that sets san francisco s apart is the sheer scale of its recycling and composting operations all of the city s recyclables are brought to recycle center a square foot warehouse on pier that processes to tons of materials per hour a team of people work alongside high tech screens magnets and optical sorters to weed out contamination and separate the paper metals and plastics similar materials are placed in a bale together and shipped out to recycling plants both domestically and abroad as for the compost all of the city s yard waste and food scraps are brought to jepson prairie organics in vacaville about miles northeast of san francisco here compostables are weighed ground up and blended eventually the nutrient rich product is sold as fertilizer to vineyards in wine country and nut growers in the central valley greg pryor general manager of jepson prairie said this was one of the first facilities in the u s to compost food scraps when we started in with food there wasn t anybody doing it on a commercial scale that we were processing and a lot of naysayers in the beginning he said today they can t argue with our success it can be done both recycle central and jepson prairie host national and international visitors who are eager to learn how they can replicate san francisco s success while san francisco s waste management system costs about million annually the program is funded solely through waste collection fees which are no higher than average for the bay area furthermore a complex recycling and composting operation can be an engine for job growth raphael said that for each ton of material more jobs are created when you recycle than if you put that material in a landfill what will it take to get to zero,pos

he transformed a trailer into a free dental clinics barbourville kentucky cnn when dr edwin smith was a young dentist beginning his career in eastern kentucky he encountered many patients with rampant tooth decay i saw a lot of patients who hadn t seen a dentist before said smith a kentucky native appalachia has one of the worst dental health problems in the nation and kentucky has the third highest rate of tooth loss smith treated patients who had tried to pull out their teeth with pliers others had superglued their teeth back onto their gums and he saw people who were sick from chronic infection but the most heartbreaking stories came from his youngest patients i would see a lot of kids who had a mouth full of rotting teeth smith said they were in pain and they d be hurting at school so in smith created a mobile clinic to bring free dental care to children in need dr edwin smith and his staff use a mobile clinic to bring free dental care to students across kentucky since then his nonprofit kids first dental services has treated more than children throughout kentucky i hope none of these kids ever have poor oral health and bad teeth as a barrier to keep them from moving up in life and bettering themselves he said cnn s laura klairmont spoke with smith about his work below is an edited version of their conversation cnn you were born and raised in appalachia what makes this region special to you smith what you see right away is the beauty i think it s the most beautiful place i ve ever been we have the mountains and trees and lakes we have lots of talented resourceful people who live here real craftsmen and just good solid people the only disadvantage is there s not a lot of economic opportunity with jobs poverty is a serious issue unfortunately when we make the news most of the time it s talking about the poverty and the negative people from appalachia feel like they re stereotyped as toothless barefoot and uneducated cnn appalachia does have some of the worst dental health problems in the country why do you think that is smith the number one issue is education when i first started practicing i would see babies being fed bottles filled with sugary drinks also many people can t afford to get treatment done and many of these families don t have the transportation that they need to access it just watched cnn hero dr edwin smith miles of smiles replay more videos must watch cnn hero dr edwin smith miles of smiles it s also the history here people have been poor here in the past and they didn t have means for taking care of their teeth people have that fatalistic notion that if my parents lost their teeth early i m going to lose mine anyway so what s the point in getting them fixed people let their teeth go that s why it is so important to educate the kids if you teach them early on they ll take better care of their teeth and won t have these problems later on in life cnn how did your nonprofit work evolve smith we wanted to help kids access preventative dental care so we turned a trailer into a mobile dental clinic at first we went to a couple schools then other schools around the county started asking us if we could come to see them in a couple years we had school districts all around kentucky asking us to come and see their students we saw so much need that hadn t been met now there are schools we go back to each year and with every year we see more improvement in the oral health of these kids cnn what services does your mobile dental clinic offer smith we provide free checkups for kids we give them dental exams clean their teeth do x rays when needed apply fluoride do sealants on any permanent molars that don t have decay in them and we make a treatment plan of any other needs that they have the restorative work or extractions they need done because we don t have the ability to do invasive procedures in the mobile clinic the hill family patients of dr smith show off their smiles that treatment plan is sent home to the parents i do that follow up treatment for any of the kids who are able to come to my private practice but in some cases it s too far away so we also provide a directory of local dentists in different areas who ve agreed to provide follow up care cnn what does this work mean to you smith i felt like i had a calling to do this it was just something that was laid out in front of me that needed to be done and no one else was doing it just seeing that we re still making a difference keeps me going when i see kids at schools we ve been providing treatment to for years and how much the incidence of tooth decay in the kids there has been reduced that s motivation enough i ve had people get up out of their chair look in the mirror and cry people who before wouldn t even let you see their teeth and now they ve got these big wide smiles that s one of the most rewarding things want to get involved check out the kids first dental services website

air by the time she turned abby had tried about eight different anti seizure medications none of them worked very well panicked to see their daughter getting worse and worse the muszynskis drove three hours to orlando to see dr ngoc minh le a board certified pediatric neurologist and epileptologist le told them that chances of another anti seizure drug working on abby were tiny he recommended medical marijuana the timing was right just months before gov rick scott had legalized the use of a type of non euphoric cannabis called charlotte s web the formulation had been a miracle for a little girl with epilepsy named charlotte figi the muszynskis had seen her story on dr sanjay gupta s cnn documentary weed charlotte s web did help abby but not as much as it had helped charlotte she still was having about two grand mal seizures a week each lasting about eight to minutes le explained to kim and rich that charlotte s web has only tiny amounts of thc one of the psychoactive ingredients in marijuana medical marijuana with higher levels of thc was abby s best hope he told them but at this point in high thc marijuana wasn t legal in florida for abby to get it the muszynskis would have to move leaving behind their friends and family including two older children kim thought about colorado where charlotte figi lived she d checked with parents of disabled children there and they told her the state had a fair and efficient medicaid program getting to colorado would be a challenge abby s doctors said it wasn t safe for her to fly on a commercial plane or to take a long car ride across the country the muszynskis began their final fight with florida medicaid one that would leave kim and abby homeless for several days kim says that in mid august she started talking to medicaid officials about getting an air ambulance to colorado on september rich drove the family car out to colorado they planned for kim to attend the closing on their house in boynton beach on september and leave on the air ambulance with abby that afternoon kim had emailed and spoken with various florida officials and it seemed to her that everything was in order please give a call today so we can finalize travel arrangements mary joyce a senior registered nurse supervisor at children s medical services at the florida department of health wrote in an email to kim on september but then several days passed and there was still no final approval for the transport their house sold kim and abby were homeless they moved in with kim s best friend and her husband all of abby s equipment like her bed with guardrails was with rich on their way to colorado kim slept with abby on the floor abby s cries at night kept kim s friends awake kim wrote emails begging florida officials for help but for the first time she added someone not previously included on the email this cnn reporter three days later she learned that the transport had been approved a spokeswoman for florida s agency for health care administration gave this statement in this case relocation services are not covered by medicaid per federal medicaid guidelines however thanks to safety net funds made available by governor scott and the legislature the state supported this family by covering the costs to provide relocation services via the air ambulance of the mother s choice working with the family the state arranged transport as quickly as possible wrote the spokeswoman mallory mcmanus paramedics transport abby muszynski to the air ambulance that will fly her from florida to colorado on september an ambulance picked up mother and daughter and brought them to boca raton airport abby s grandmother and aunt said a prayer over abby s stretcher as it was loaded on the plane as they prepared to leave kim said she felt like a refugee in her own country i feel like i m being forced out of my home she said but when kim and abby arrived in colorado springs rich was there to welcome them to their new home the most incredible thing i ve ever seen within a few weeks of arriving in colorado the muszynskis felt like they d been visited by not one but two miracles first the high thc marijuana has almost completely eradicated abby s grand mal seizures when they left florida she was having about two to four a week each lasting about to minutes in colorado she s had about one a week and they last only a few seconds just a drop of high thc marijuana oil under her tongue stops the seizures almost immediately it s the most incredible thing i ve ever seen kim said she hasn t had to go to the hospital for seizures in colorado at all abby muszynski takes high thc medical marijuana for the first time in colorado the second miracle is that so far colorado medicaid has paid for all of abby s prescriptions and doctors visits without a problem a far cry from their experience in florida all the hours kim spent fighting medicaid can now be spent with her daughter now that abby is essentially free of grand mal seizures she s made strides she can grasp a fork she can pick up a block and move it these are small steps for a typical child but huge for abby and more and more her parents see her personality come out she smiles and giggles more than she used to at a balloon floating in the room or when her parents blow bubbles kim and rich wonder if maybe just maybe abby will one day be able to learn some very rudimentary sign language to express what she wants maybe she ll be able to take a step with a walker and lots of support despite abby s improved health it s been tough on the muszynskis to be in colorado two weeks after they moved their elder daughter christina facetimed kim and rich from florida to show off her new driver s license abby muszynski and her older sister christina kim rejoiced with her daughter but she later broke down in tears knowing that she d missed this important milestone she knows she ll miss other big days like cooking thanksgiving dinner with her daughter and shopping for a prom dress and prom itself and recently christina who s living with her biological father has been having dizzy spells and fainting it pains kim that she s not there to help her on november six weeks after the muszynskis moved to colorado florida voters approved a ballot initiative giving more patients like abby access to cannabis with higher thc levels and about two months before kim and rich left florida medicaid started to give them enough doses of diastat the expensive anti seizure medication they d had to fight for even so the muszynskis said they still would have made the choice to leave florida the medicaid system there was just too unreliable they said they never knew when it would stop paying for abby s medicines or her equipment or her respiratory therapist or if it would kick her off the program altogether as it did three times in less than three years florida was unable to meet the needs of our medically fragile child kim said it ultimately could have resulted in her death kim muszynski says abby s improvement is the most incredible thing i ve ever seen abby s not alone there s a saying among medicaid experts when you ve seen one medicaid program you ve seen one medicaid program that s because although there are federal standards states have a great deal of leeway about how they manage their programs nearly four out of children in the united states are on medicaid and care in one state can look very different than care in another though there are no official rankings of state medicaid systems experts say there are data that can help gauge quality for example some state medicaid programs pay doctors relatively low amounts which means doctors are more likely to stop accepting patients on medicaid florida ranks the fifth lowest in the country in medicaid payments paying lower than the national average according to an analysis by the urban institute of payments made in mcmanus the spokeswoman for florida s agency for health care administration noted that the urban institute numbers are based on fee for service physician rates but the state s medicaid program predominantly operates managed care plans the state says it has transitioned to the managed care system over the past few years these rates do not reflect how the majority of medicaid providers are paid she wrote stephen zuckerman the lead author of the urban institute report said there s not much difference between the amounts paid by fee for service and managed care pointing to a report by the us government accountability office pdf a nonpartisan agency that works for congress that shows only a difference critics of florida s medicaid program also point to a report pdf this year by a group led by joan alker executive director of the center for children and families at georgetown university who s studied florida medicaid for more than a decade the small survey of pediatricians concluded that challenges exist for children enrolling in and accessing care through florida s managed care system and that barriers to getting their patients the prescription and over the counter medications they needed were also a serious concern for pediatricians in a letter to the sarasota herald tribune dudek then the secretary of the state agency for health care administration said the georgetown report was biased noting that the response rate was less than of physicians participating in medicaid join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter overall advocates for families on medicaid say florida isn t the only state where doctors and parents have expressed dissatisfaction noting that families have fled other states not just florida in search of better medicaid services this isn t unique to florida but florida certainly has serious problems alker said she said her heart breaks for the parents who must provide around the clock care to severely disabled children these families already face incredible struggles she said these families are my heroes they don t need the state of florida making it harder for them she added the state of florida should be

easton toddler denied m gene therapy will now get it for free i was shocked but i m excited and i m very grateful her mother marisa boidi said monday of avexis s reversal which followed a globe story on thursday concerning the denial of her application it s going to give her a better chance at life illinois based avexis a subsidiary of the swiss drug giant novartis has agreed to provide zolgensma an intravenous gene therapy that requires only one dose free to natalia boidi through a compassionate use program she has spinal muscular atrophy which kills more infants than any other inherited disorder a year old easton girl who was deemed ineligible for the world s most expensive drug will get the million medicine to treat her rare genetic disease after all advertisement afflicting one in every to babies spinal muscular atrophy or sma attacks the neurons that control muscle function its most dire form kills most children by their second birthday natalia can t swallow liquids has a feeding tube inserted into her abdomen uses a breathing machine at night and often needs her parents to clear mucus from her airways with a suction device during a reporter s recent visit to her house she watched tv with an oxygen monitor tethered to the big toe on her right foot before the drug won food and drug administration approval on may avexis had been providing it free to some patients under its compassionate use protocol but the program was limited to children with type sma the worst form of the disease based on natalia s medical records the novartis subsidiary concluded that she had type a milder form and denied her application but after receiving more documentation from natalia s neurologist at massachusetts general hospital after the globe story was published avexis concluded the toddler did indeed have the worst form and was entitled to receive zolgensma as an experimental drug advertisement we are pleased that we are able to treat this child under the program that avexis set up with the fda now that we have received the proper documentation a company spokeswoman said in an e mail to the globe although the compassionate use program ended the day the fda approved zolgensma natalia and several other patients were already in a queue to receive it if deemed eligible avexis said natalia is expected to get the medicine later this month according to the staff of her neurologist dr kathryn swoboda the fda approved zolgensma for all forms of the disease but only for children up to the age of the compassionate use program made the drug available free to type patients older than if they weighed less than pounds and met other criteria natalia weighs pounds swoboda said she believes the turn of events illustrates that the way the medical world classifies the four forms of spinal muscular atrophy may need to change there was never any doubt in her mind that natalia had the worst form swoboda said natalia began gasping for air in when she was about five weeks old and had a breathing tube temporarily inserted into her throat she spent more than two months in the pediatric intensive care unit at mass general but since late natalia has received injections of an earlier breakthrough drug spinraza sold by the cambridge biotech biogen approved the year before spinraza was the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy it s injected into the spinal canal and helps make more of a protein that controls muscle movement advertisement that drug doesn t come cheap either it s for each milliliter dose patients need six doses the first year at a cost of and three doses every year afterward at an annual expense of spinraza saved natalia s life swoboda said but the girl s survival and ability to sit briefly now the neurologist said evidently led avexis officials to incorrectly believe she had the less severe form of the disease and didn t need zolgensma i think it s the right decision she said of avexis s change of heart i personally believe she will have a significant added benefit from the gene therapy spinraza has helped her tremendously but she has a lot of ongoing medical issues in clinical trials zolgensma helped infants and young children breathe on their own and achieve motor milestones like sitting up without support avexis hardly wants more controversy about zolgensma last tuesday the fda disclosed that the company had delayed disclosing to the government that one or more people at the subsidiary had manipulated animal testing data for the gene therapy although the agency said the drug should remain on the market a group of senators including presidential hopefuls elizabeth warren of massachusetts and bernie sanders of vermont subsequently blasted novartis in a letter to the fda the data manipulation they wrote smacks of the pharmaceutical industry s privilege and greed advertisement the fda has said it s considering whether to bring civil or criminal penalties against novartis and

socialization aspect says pardasani we re human beings we ve been socialized to be social animals and the diner is a social place you can see it in the customers joking with the staff the people who bring in an older neighbors the seniors who carpool together for a meal young people like amber zukauskus come for that camaraderie just as much as for the little pies everyone here is so nice says zukauskus and they pay everybody a living wage and so all your tips just go to donations for meals on wheels which is amazing that s something i want to give money to the diner has gone through the usual hiccups of starting a new restaurant dealing with staffing figuring out the lunch rush adjusting portion size so that seniors might have some extra to take home and eat later meals on wheels people received some grant money to help with start up costs and they expect to turn a profit in their third year but even early on they seem to be hitting their stride it s a bustling thriving business chris bingenheimer learned about the diner from a friend and came in to share a meal he sometimes goes to a senior center but was never a fan of the made in advance food or the minimal choices or of the fact he had to be called up for a meal like at the high school cafeteria he said he ll definitely be back to the diner the staff is very friendly says bingenheimer they don t look down on you because you re with the meals on wheels program they treat you kindly the service is impeccable bingenheimer is a senior using meals on wheels and at the diner he s also just a guy sitting

hiv vaccine in leading experts optimistic about ongoing trials the global fight against the human immunodeficiency virus is poised to make important advances thanks to three experimental hiv vaccines that are entering the final stages of testing at sites across the globe while any of these three late stage hiv vaccine trials known as hvtn imbokodo and mosaico could fail scientists say they are more hopeful than at any time since when secretary of health and human services margaret heckler raised hopes by predicting that there would be a test worthy hiv vaccine within two years this is perhaps one of the most optimistic moments we have been in said dr susan buchbinder director of the bridge hiv research program at the san francisco department of public health and a chair of both the imbokodo and mosaico trials we have three vaccines currently being tested in efficacy trials she said and it takes quite a bit to actually be promising enough in the earlier stages stages of trials to move you forward into an efficacy study hvtn the oldest ongoing hiv vaccine trial known as hvtn is based on a prior vaccine candidate rv that was effective but not effective enough in the rv clinical trial released findings showing that the vaccine lowered the rate of hiv infections by about percent to this day rv remains the only hiv vaccine that have ever demonstrated any efficacy against the virus hvtn launched in south africa in was the first vaccine trial approved after the failure of rv according to the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the modified vaccination regime aims to provide greater and more sustained protection than the rv regimen and has been adapted to the hiv subtype that predominates in southern africa also known as hiv clade c while rv at percent effective did not suffice for global distribution it pointed the way forward for vaccine researchers who adapted rv s successes to create hvtn buchbinder said even a partially effective vaccine would be a tremendous breakthrough and would really have the power to change the trajectory of the epidemic dr anthony fauci director of niaid and a longtime advocate for a vaccine that is at least percent effective said he feels even more strongly now that a partially effective vaccine would be worth deploying he said that is because prevention strategies like pre exposure prophylaxis prep and treatment as prevention tasp are being so successfully used even in the absence of a vaccine that if one or more of these vaccines look good have a percent efficacy i think that s going to be the game changer for turning the epidemic around hvtn completed enrollment this summer and clinical results are expected in late or early imbokodo and mosaico imbokodo the second trial began in five southern african nations in and completed enrollment of women this summer in southern african nations heterosexual women are at extremely high risk of hiv infection it s almost unbelievable but it s true women between the ages of and the prevalence of infection is well over percent fauci said if ever you wanted to get a population that if the vaccine works you re going to know pretty quickly then you want to go in women unlike hvtn imbokodo uses mosaic immunogens which are vaccine components designed to induce immune responses against a wide variety of global hiv strains according to the national institutes of health the presumption is that a mosaic is going to give you broader coverage fauci said in november the third vaccine trial mosaico marked its informal start after the first study participant received an injection mosaico is based on imbokodo s unique mosaic immunogen approach imbokodo and mosaico are largely identical and consist of six injections with slightly different vaccine formulations administered during the final two clinic visits in addition while imbokodo is only being tested in african women mosaico will recruit gay men and transgender people for its clinical trials at sites in the united states latin america and europe for any hiv vaccine fauci said there s a need to prove it works in different at risk populations imbokodo completed enrollment of study participants this summer marking the formal end of the recruitment process results from imbokodo are expected in and results from mosaico are expected in challenges ahead fauci noted that there has been a rapid pace of vaccine related developments in recent years with these three vaccine trials starting in and in all of these trials intermittently the data and safety monitoring board takes a look at the data and either says the data are so bad you have got to stop or the data are so overwhelmingly good that you have got to stop fauci said so far after several reviews of the data in hvtn and imbokodo there s nothing there to say stop the study which happened in when a merck vaccine trial was shut down after the monitoring board determined that it had no impact on prevention none of these vaccines is a particularly simple regimen buchbinder said so it s going to require quite a bit of effort to deploy they require multiple injections and so each one would require a minimum of four different doses in its current configuration buchbinder said but an effective vaccine could be a stepping off point to potentially create a simpler and more effective vaccine in the future and if these vaccine trials all fail public health officials say enough tools currently exist to stop the spread of hiv if only people would or could use them prep the daily pill that prevents hiv infection is safe and effective but not enough people are using it to slow hiv transmission and end the epidemic and successful treatment of people living with hiv results in an undetectable viral load that they cannot transmit the virus via sexual activity known as treatment as prevention or tasp it goes exactly to what i have been saying for years and years if you implement the tools that you have you will definitely see an impact on the dynamics of the epidemic fauci said i have been talking about this for well over a decade if you implement the incidence is going to go down it happened dramatically in san francisco and it is happening right now in new york fauci said president donald trump s ending the hiv epidemic plan which fauci played a central role in drafting aims to lower new infections by percent in five years and by percent in years even in the absence of a vaccine so if one of the three vaccines currently being tested works that would be the endgame she said follow nbc

revolutionary device allowed frogs to regenerate lost limbs frogs with amputated legs had enhanced limb regeneration when fitted with a revolutionary device scientists claim this so called bioreactor helps the animals regrow legs by kick starting the advanced healing process using the hormone progesterone progesterone is crucial to pregnancy and it is now believed that the chemical could help find a cure for spinal cord injuries scroll down for video scientists claim this so called bioreactor helps the animals regrow legs by kick starting the advanced healing process using the hormone progesterone adult aquatic african clawed frogs were fitted with a specialist bioreactor that uses the hormone progesterone to improve healing findings published today in the journal cell reports introduce a new model for testing electroceuticals or cell stimulating therapies study senior author dr michael levin developmental biologist at tufts university said at best adult frogs normally grow back only a featureless thin cartilaginous spike our procedure induced a regenerative response they normally never have which resulted in bigger more structured appendages the bioreactor device triggered very complex downstream outcomes that bioengineers cannot yet micromanage directly the scientists d printed the bioreactor out of silicon and filled it with hydrogel a sticky glob of polymers they laced the hydrogel with hydrating silk proteins that promote healing and regeneration before adding progesterone progesterone is a steroid hormone which is best known for its pivotal role in the menstrual and ovulation cycle performed every month by women it is also known to promote nerve blood vessel and bone tissue repair the researchers split the frogs into three groups experimental control and sham for the experimental and sham group they sutured the device on the frogs immediately after limb amputation in the experimental group the bioreactor released progesterone onto the amputation site in all cases they removed the devices after hours when they looked at frogs in the experimental group at different stages over nine and a half months the team witnessed the bioreactor instigated a degree of limb regeneration not observed in the other groups instead of a spike like structure the bioreactor treatment resulted in a paddle like growth that resembled a fully formed limb dr levin said the bioreactor device created a supportive environment for the wound where the tissue could grow as it did during embryogenesis a very brief application of bioreactor and its payload triggered months of tissue growth and patterning when dr levin and his team took a closer look at the regenerated structures they saw that unlike in the control and sham groups the limbs of the bioreactor treated frogs were thicker with more developed bones innervation and vascularisation the team also analysed video footage of the frogs in their tanks found the frogs treated with progesterone could swim more like unamputated frogs further analysis revealed that the bioreactor had altered the gene expression occurring in cells at the amputation site dr levin explained that genes involved in oxidative stress serotonergic signalling and white blood cell activity were upregulated while some other signaling related genes were downregulated what is progesterone progesterone is a hormone that is secreted by the corpus luteum a temporary endocrine gland that the female body produces after ovulation it prepares the body for the possibility of pregnancy after ovulation it causes a thickening of the uterus lining to allow for an egg to embed into the wall after a woman s cycle is completed and they are not pregnant the gland breaks down and the menstrual cycle begins if a woman does become pregnant the chemical continues to be produced to maintain the layer and provide oxygen to the developing fetus said to be oestrogen s cousin or the relaxing hormone is thought to help to maintain pregnancy it is not typically prescribed on the nhs in the uk unless a woman has three or more miscarriages in a row if progesterone levels are too low with regard to estrogen levels a woman will experience sleep disturbances irritability anxiety weight gain breast swelling breast tenderness and itching bloating sweating loss of memory and loss of libido despite its widespread use in pregnancy the hormone has also been shown to promote nerve blood vessel and bone tissue repair this has therefore brought around applications in tissue regeneration advertisement the researchers also observed that scarring and immune responses were downregulated in the bioreactor treated frogs suggesting that the added progesterone dampened the body s natural reaction to injury in a way that benefited the regeneration process dr celia herrera rincon a neuroscientist in dr levin s lab at tufts university said in both reproduction and its newly discovered role in brain functioning progesterone s actions are local or tissue specific what we are demonstrating with this approach is that maybe reproduction brain processing and regeneration are closer than we think maybe they share pathways and elements of a common and so far not completely understood bioelectrical code the team also analysed video footage of the frogs in their tanks found the frogs treated with progesterone could swim more like unamputated frogs further analysis revealed that the bioreactor had altered the gene expression occurring in cells at the amputation site dr levin said his team will continue to target bioelectric processes for inducing spinal cord regeneration and tumour reprogramming they also hope to replicate their bioreactor experiment in mammals previous research suggests that mice can partially regenerate amputated fingertips in the right conditions but their life on land hinders the process dr levin added almost all good regenerators are aquatic you can imagine why this matters a mouse that loses a finger or hand and then grinds the delicate regenerative cells into the flooring material as it walks around is unlikely to experience significant limb regeneration now he plans to add sensors to the device for remote monitoring and stimulation which he hopes will improve control over cellular decision making after injury,pos
taxing beef lamb and pork could prevent about deaths a year a meat tax on bacon burgers and beef could save lives and billion around the world within two years experts say making red meat heavily linked to cancer and heart disease more expensive could encourage people to switch to eating healthier alternatives in the uk this could prevent deaths a year and save more than million which would otherwise have been spent on healthcare but it could hike the price of red meat like mince and steak by per cent and the cost of processed meat like bacon and burgers by per cent oxford university researchers said eating red and processed meat kills million people a year and costs the global economy billion they acknowledged no one wants governments to tell people what they can eat but cutting down red meat would be better for human health and for the earth in the uk an optimal meat tax could increase the cost of red meat by per cent and processed meat by per cent researchers say which would put prices up on supermarket shelves pictured examples of how supermarket prices could change based on prices on tesco direct lead researcher dr marco springmann said the consumption of red and processed meat exceeds recommended levels in most high and middle income countries this is having significant impacts not only on personal health but also on healthcare systems which are taxpayer funded in many countries and on the economy which is losing its labour force due to ill health and care for family members who fall ill i hope governments will consider introducing a health levy on red and processed meat to make healthy and sustainable decision making easier for consumers a health levy on red and processed meat would not limit choices but send a powerful signal to consumers and take pressure off our healthcare systems the size of the meat tax would vary in different countries around the world depending on how much meat they eat and how much it costs to buy the study estimated a tax could reduce the intake of processed meat like bacon and sausages by around two portions a week in high income countries five ways to encourage people to eat less meat filippo bianchi an expert researcher at oxford university has suggested five ways society can discourage people from eating as much red meat which is linked to cancer heart disease and type diabetes he writes for the conversation reduce portion size reducing the default portion size of meat products is a promising way forward one study found that downsizing the default portion size of meat dishes in restaurants got each customer to consume on average g less meat in these dishes without affecting their overall restaurant experience another study found that adding smaller sausages to supermarket shelves was linked with a reduction in meat purchases so simply making smaller meat portions available in supermarkets could also help to cut down meat consumption design greener menus how foods are displayed on restaurant menus also makes a difference research has shown that creating an exclusive vegetarian section at the end of a restaurant menu actually reduces the likelihood of people trying plant based foods instead displaying the meat options on a separate restaurant board and only keeping plant based options on the default paper menu made people four times more likely to go with a meat free option according to a study conducted in a simulated canteen position meat out of sight research showed that making veggie options more visible than meat at the counter of a university canteen was linked with a per cent increase in the selection of meat free dishes and when it comes to a buffet setup placing the meat options at the end of the aisle is probably the way to go one small study found that this buffet layout could cut people s meat intakes by up to per cent but given the small sample size more research is needed to corroborate this finding help people make the obvious connection reminding people of where meat actually comes from can also make quite a difference to how much meat people end up eating research shows for example that presenting the image of a pork roast with the pig s head still attached increases people s demand for a plant based alternative develop delicious meat free products of course making vegetarian dishes delicious sounding enough to compete with meat ones seems like a good idea and a recent study found that increasing the look and appeal of meat free options on the menu of a simulated university cafeteria doubled the amount of people who selected meat free meals over traditional meat dishes so while it s still early days and much more research needs to be done to understand how to encourage people to eat less meat ultimately making meat free options more appealing will be key to reducing long term meat consumption source the conversation advertisement scientific evidence links eating red meat to cancer heart disease and stroke and restricting how much people eat by making it more expensive could cut down the number of people who die of related diseases experts say in the uk the optimal tax level could increase the cost of red meat by per cent and processed meat by per cent dr springmann said but the uk comes off fairly lightly ideal processed meat tax in the us could be per cent whereas it could be per cent in sweden the uk figures could see the price of an eight pack of tesco british pork sausages rise from to for example or four of tesco s lb beef burgers could cost instead of the current the price hike would be more modest for fresh red meat like steak a sirloin steak might rise from to or lamb chops from to in the us the tax would need to be higher rising the cost of meat by per cent and processed meat by per cent how the meat tax could change supermarket prices based on the possible tax rates of per cent for unprocessed red meat and per cent for processed meat these are some examples of how tesco prices could change tesco smoked back bacon rashers g now with tax tesco british pork sausages pack g now with tax tesco lb beef burgers g now with tax tesco beef lean steak mince g fat now with tax tesco sirloin steak g now with tax tesco lamb chops g now with tax prices are all from tesco direct advertisement an effective tax in sweden increased the price of processed meat by a whopping per cent and that of red meat by per cent but in china optimal tax levels were much lower just seven per cent on red meat and per cent on processed meat the study found taxing meat in germany at an effective level led to red meat being per cent more expensive and the price of processed meat rising by per cent the same policy in denmark resulted in red meat being taxed at per cent and processed meat at per cent the potential global benefits of a meat tax include a per cent reduction in processed meat consumption and the prevention of deaths from cancer heart disease stroke and type diabetes in addition an estimated deaths related to obesity would be prevented the study found for the uk alone an effective meat tax that offset healthcare costs would prevent deaths per year that would amount to a reduction of per cent in the number of deaths attributed to eating meat louise meincke from the world cancer research fund said governments need to implement more evidence informed policies to help make our daily environments healthier so that it is easier for people to make these healthy choices this research looking at the potential effects of a meat tax shows it could help reduce the level of meat consumption similar to how a sugar sweetened beverage tax works as well as offset costs to the healthcare system and improve environmental sustainability a higher tax on processed meat would price consumers out of eating so much and move them towards unprocessed meat believed to be healthier researchers said the world health organisation has classified beef lamb and pork as carcinogenic meaning they cause cancer when eaten in processed form and the meats are still probably cancer causing when they re consumed unprocessed red meat consumption has also been associated with increased rates of coronary heart disease stroke and type diabetes the research was published in the journal public library of science one,pos
u s trial to tell epic tale of mexican drug lord el chapo new york the high security trial of infamous mexican drug lord joaquin el chapo guzman got underway on tuesday with a prosecutor telling jurors how the man who got his start in a modest marijuana selling business in mexico ruthlessly turned it into a blood drenched smuggling operation that funneled cocaine and other drugs as far north as new york assistant u s attorney adam fels told a jury in a new york city courtroom that guzman sent killers to wipe out competitors and waged wars against longtime partners including his own cousins guzman who has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the united states early last year has pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multi billion dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached new york new jersey texas and elsewhere north of the border if convicted he faces a possible life prison sentence prosecutors have said they will use thousands of documents videos and recordings as evidence including material related to drug smugglers safe houses and guzman s prison escape and the law enforcement operation to recapture him fels described to jurors how guzman started modestly in the early s by selling marijuana in mexico but built his reputation by constructing tunnels across the mexico u s border to transport marijuana and cocaine so fast that he was no longer el chapo the short one instead he became known as the speedy one before his tunnels it had taken weeks to move drugs across the border to the u s before long guzman was receiving to planes stuffed with cocaine from colombia at landing strips in mexico for transport to cities like los angeles chicago and new york fels said as his business flourished using the tunnels trains planes and vessels guzman began taking aim at rivals in the early s leading to bloody wars in he fled to guatemala but was captured and imprisoned in mexico for eight years where he continued running his drug empire fels said the prosecutor spoke of two dramatic escapes from prison by guzman and said he was planning a third when he was brought to the u s fels said guzman used some of his wealth to pay off the mexican military and police and to finance assault rifles grenade launchers and explosives to engage in war after bloody war more than a dozen co operating witnesses are scheduled to testify including some who worked for guzman s sinaloa cartel prosecutors say they risk retribution by taking the stand and the court has taken steps to conceal their identities u s district judge brian cogan barred courtroom sketch artists from drawing them guzman s lawyers are expected to attack the credibility of the witnesses by emphasizing their criminal records saying some have an incentive to lie to win leniency in their own cases one of guzman s attorneys eduardo balarezo has suggested that he hopes to convince jurors guzman wasn t actually in charge of the cartel but was a lieutenant taking orders from someone else now that trial is upon us it is time to put up or shut up balarezo said despite his diminutive stature and nickname that means shorty guzman was once a larger than life figure in mexico who has been compared to al capone and robin hood and been the subject of ballads called narcocorridos among the highlights of his lore he was known for carrying a gold plated ak for smuggling cocaine in cans marked as jalapenos and for making shipments using planes with secret landing strips as well as container ships speedboats and even submarines but guzman is perhaps best known for escaping custody in mexico the first time in by hiding in the bottom of a laundry bin he escaped again in through a mile long tunnel dug into a shower in his jail cell that he slipped into before fleeing on a motorcycle guzman s second escape was a black eye for the mexican government an embarrassment amplified when the actor sean penn was able to find and interview him at one of his hideouts in mexico while he was on the run from authorities guzman s extradition to new york city shook up mexico s drug underworld mexican security analyst alejandro hope said it created something of a civil war within the sinaloa cartel that has essentially ended with the arrest of internal rivals and allowed his sons to take control of what remains a weakened but far from finished smuggling operation hope said he has seen no sign that guzman s extradition and jailing in the u s had a major impact on drug flows or routes but symbolically i think it s important it s a bit of an end of an era there are very few kingpins of that size left of that importance hope said we are actually leaving behind that era the era of the kingpin smaller gangs now dominate he said raul benitez a security expert and professor at the national autonomous university of mexico said guzman s oversized myth has been fading too in mexico news stories about guzman s trial have been prominent in the media even though it s viewed by some as old history he is totally isolated he cannot approach anyone his wife was not even able to approach him so he is now out of the game benitez said referring to an order by the judge banning guzman s wife from hugging him in the courtroom during the trial whether he is out for good will be

we need their brains donating to the brain bank in search of a dementia cure it s a rainy wednesday morning and dr andrew affleck is driving more carefully than usual on his way to the neuroscience research australia building in randwick it s not just the slick crowded roads putting the edge on his caution in the boot of his car cocooned in several layers of protective container and nestled in ice is the brain of a human being who was alive only a few hours earlier it s no ordinary brain if any brain could be said to be ordinary but one that has a deadly secret buried inside the individual who was until recently embodied within this mass of pink grey and white tissue died of one of the neurodegenerative diseases that are increasingly a cause of death for our ageing population perhaps it was alzheimer s disease that gradually robbed them of their connection to reality or frontotemporal dementia that transformed their personality or parkinson s disease that shook their body and mind dr andrew affleck a research associate at the sydney brain bank whatever claimed their life this organ is on its way to the sydney brain bank i really hope that this is the brain that will get us across the line says affleck at the sydney brain bank housed within neura the hope is that scientists will be able to glean some new and vital insight from their tissue and maybe one day that insight will lead to a better understanding a better treatment or even a cure every donation bringing the tissue back into the laboratory i say to myself i really hope that this is the tipping point says affleck a research associate at the sydney brain bank that is really exciting and gets you wanting to do the best you can not only for science but for the family themselves adele lusson research assistant preparing paraffin embedded tissue sections for staining the inside of the sydney brain bank looks like a typical research facility carpeted offices walled with glass and laboratories where every available space is filled with equipment glassware and folders but everything is scrupulously clean and tidy there are no brains in jars or any hollywood esque embellishments that might give a visitor any sense of the or so brains and some spinal cords that have passed through the hands of the scientists here several floors below the gleaming laboratories in a basement that s normally accessed via a goods lift is a room about the size of a typical boardroom it s filled with mobile shelves that can be separated and moved with the touch of a button the shelves are lined with sealed white plastic buckets each containing one half of a brain that has been preserved in formalin dr claire shepherd director of the sydney brain bank is almost apologetic about it the buckets don t look very glamorous or scientific but years of experience have told us that they re the best vehicle to store the brains in she explains the room is temperature controlled at a comfortable warmth and is totally silent apart from a few electronic beeps as the powered shelves are moved apart it s a peaceful space like being in a room full of deep sleepers the other halves of each of these preserved brains are stored upstairs in ultra low freezers at celsius the sydney brain bank is one of many such facilities around australia and around the world whose purpose is to collect brain and spinal cord tissue from people afflicted with a variety of diseases and conditions that tissue is made available to researchers searching for answers to the questions of why these diseases happen how they progress and what can be done to treat halt or prevent them the sydney brain bank s focus is neurodegenerative diseases in particular the dementias and the movement disorders such as parkinson s disease motor neurone disease huntington s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy brain donation is a different beast to organ donation not the least because one is for transplant while the other is for research a lot of people just think that it s on their organ donation card and they ask me can i donate my brain because i m an organ donor shepherd says but donating a brain is far more complex because for scientists to get the most information from that donated tissue they need to know about the donor s life before they died the donors connected to the sydney brain bank are recruited through a network of specialist neurologists and clinics around sydney who collect standardised data about their patients such as their medical history and the unique history and features of their disease this data includes blood tests and regular imaging with technology such as mri then the value of the tissue is really enriched because we not only have the tissue but we have all this information about what the individual looked like in life and it s standardised information on cohorts of individuals as well shepherd says andrew affleck removing tissue sections from the automated slide stainer however the donor s personal identity and life are hidden from the staff and researchers who work with the tissue it has to be that way not just for privacy reasons but also for the benefit of the staff who handle the donated brains shepherd recalls the family member of a donor who had died who sent the bank a homemade booklet about the donor s life and who they were seeing that snapshot of the donor s life was an intensely emotional experience for shepherd and that emotion is still very close to the surface i am the custodian of the brain tissue she says that doesn t mean i m insensitive to who that person is obviously but i don t have that close relationship and it would be dangerous if i did i think because it would affect me on this level every day time is the enemy of organ donation the longer an organ whether heart kidney or brain remains inside a body that is no longer supplying it with life giving oxygen the more the tissue breaks down and the poorer the quality of the information can be gleaned from it l r removing tissue sections from the automated slide stainer hanging lab coats the sydney brain bank staff carry pagers with them hours a day seven days a week days a year when a donor dies one of the first calls made by the family carers or medical staff is to that paging service things have to happen quickly whoever is on call then liaises with the mortuary where the body will be taken and with the funeral service one of the main things that we aim to do is to really not disrupt the funeral arrangements for the family as best we can we try and expedite the donation for them so that there s no delay affleck explains the removal of the brain and spinal cord if that is also being donated takes place at one of the few remaining operational mortuaries in sydney it s a relatively quick process a couple of hours at most then affleck or whoever is on call takes the tissue back to the brain bank once it arrives the brain is divided into two hemispheres one half is frozen along with tissue samples that are dissected from brain regions that are of particular interest to researchers the frozen tissue can later be studied under the microscope but more importantly the freezing preserves the dna proteins and biochemistry of the tissue ad le lusson research assistant preparing paraffin embedded tissue sections for staining the other half of the brain is immersed in formalin for two weeks which allows the liquid preservative to fully penetrate the brain once that process is complete that hemisphere is stored in mm sections layered on fine sheets of acetate in the white buckets that line the basement shelves at this point the brain bank staff also take smaller samples or blocks from different parts of the brain that are of interest for further study maybe there s softening or there s tissue discolouration or there s something that really does need further investigation under the microscope says affleck these smaller sections are also treated with a variety of stains that highlight the presence or absence of proteins and structures the final step is a complete standardised report that ties together what the brain bank has observed about the tissue with what was known about the donor s life and disease that information is the starting point for researchers interested in studying the tissue perhaps somewhere in these folders boxes of slides samples of tissue and pages of data is the answer they re seeking what about the donors and their families what are they seeking when they tick that box and consent to their or their loved one

people get it keith died years ago but lucille still occasionally visits neura i m part of it she says the experience has made her an advocate for brain donation and for a greater awareness and understanding of dementia when her time comes she will also donate her brain lisa webb s husband bob died around two years ago of what was diagnosed as primary progressive aphasia a gradual loss of language abilities however this was actually a symptom of parkinson s disease a diagnosis that wasn t revealed until after his death fairly soon after bob s diagnosis the subject of brain donation came up during a visit to neura for tests for him the brain was just part of the body he was always happy to donate organs and the brain was just another organ lisa says i guess i have the same view i looked at it and thought if there s anything we can do to help other people not have to go through this then let s do it the thought that bob s tissue resides somewhere in the sydney brain bank and is

amazon turtle populations recovering well thanks to local action credit university of east anglia the historically over exploited giant south american turtle is making a significant comeback on river beaches in the brazilian amazon thanks to local protection efforts say researchers at the university of east anglia and not only have turtle populations benefited from conservation efforts other co occurring species have begun to thrive once again on the protected beaches and in surrounding areas the uea team working in partnership with universidade federal de alagoas anglia ruskin university and universidade federal do amazonas analysed data collected on giant turtle populations nesting on protected beaches along the juru a major tributary of the amazon river over the past four decades they also surveyed both locally protected and unprotected beaches along a km meandering section of the same river the survey covered nests of all turtle species as well as bird iguana caiman large fish river dolphin and insect populations on either the river beaches or the adjacent river channel during the dry season their results published in nature sustainability show that giant turtle populations are well on their way to full recovery on beaches guarded by local vigilantes there are now over nine times more turtles hatching on these beaches than there were in equivalent to an annual increase of over hatchlings the beach survey showed that of over turtle nests monitored on protected beaches only two per cent were attacked by poachers in contrast on unprotected beaches poachers had harvested eggs from per cent of the nests surveyed other species also had much larger populations on protected beaches compared to beaches with no protection species benefiting from the conservation programme included migratory birds such as the black skimmer the large billed tern and the sand coloured nighthawk as well as the black caiman river dolphins green iguana and large catfishes turtles have historically been an over exploited source of meat and eggs despite the first protection laws banning turtle harvest coming into force in by the late s numbers had reached worryingly low levels the beach protection programme along the juru river is part of the largest community based conservation programme in the brazilian amazon beaches are guarded on a shoestring budget by local communities carrying out round the clock beach surveillance throughout the five month turtle breeding season prof carlos peres from uea s school of environmental sciences and a senior author on the study said this study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of empowering local management action by stakeholders who have the largest stake and a presence at key conservation sites the beaches protected by local communities represent noisy islands of high biodiversity surrounded by lifeless unprotected beaches which are invariably empty and silent the team hopes their evidence will help convince governments that supporting local conservation is critical to successful ecological restoration programmes relying on a handful of government officials who are often based in urban centres to protect five million square kilometres of amazonian rivers and forests is at best a losing battle which so far has largely failed said prof peres we need to trigger and then subsidize powerful win win alliances with local communities to both ensure their welfare and sustain the collective vigilance that can maintain the integrity of the world s largest tropical wilderness region dr joseph hawes a collaborator at anglia ruskin university said our research highlights the valuable conservation service currently provided by local communities not just for turtles but for the wider ecosystem recognising the importance of their work shows the potential for effective conservation action even outside existing formally protected areas lead author dr jo o campos silva now a postdoctoral researcher at universidade federal de alagoas brazil said currently six million people in the brazilian amazon depend on wild nature by including local dwellers in conservation practices we can increase the effectiveness of conservation outcomes and enhance local welfare we found huge differences between the ecological and social outcomes in this program but there is widespread dissatisfaction voiced by beach guards who get very little return for what can be dangerous work this means that many of them are now on the brink of giving up on decades of successful beach

nyu suicide survivor received most the sophisticated face transplant ever doctors have revealed how they carried out the most technologically advanced face transplant ever on a year old man who survived a suicide attempt and the meteorological obstacles they had to overcome to make it happen cameron cam underwood was when he took a gun held it under his chin and pulled the trigger at home alone in yuba california on june he woke up in hospital with no face except for a forehead eyeballs and tongue and he couldn t believe what he was told he had battled depression for years and he had once pithily said to his parents that he d considered suicide but he didn t think he would truly try to take his own life but there he was waking up from five weeks of heavy sedation alive against all the odds but with no face unable to eat and talk struggling to breathe and ashamed to see anyone without wearing a mask however months later his mother heard about dr eduardo rodriguez of nyu langone health who is one of a handful of doctors pioneering face transplants in the us they got in touch cam was accepted and in january a donor became available today at a press conference in new york city dr rodriguez revealed cam s was the most sophisticated face transplant ever performed with the shortest time between injury and operation despite traveling further than any other patient in history miles across the us cameron cam underwood and dr eduardo rodriguez on thursday just months after his operation the pair have built a strong bond over the past months as cam s life turned around and dr rodriguez performed the most technologically advanced face transplant ever cam sits in the front row of the press conference with his mother siblings and father as dr rodriguez explains in details for the first time how they brought cam back physically and psychologically cam underwood now lost the vast majority of his face after shooting himself in the face in a suicide attempt left today he is the recipient of the most sophisticated face transplant to date detailed at a new york university event right cam pictured skydiving within months of his surgery dr rodriguez joked i can at least check off the box that a face transplant can tolerate jumping out of the air and it all held together i think this photo shows cam is living and doing the things he loves it was almost derailed by an arctic storm the bomb cyclone which hit the us in january thanks to the generosity of certain pilots cam managed to get on one of the only flights permitted from california to new york that day so he could undergo the groundbreaking operation but it was a success and his recovery has been faster than any other case to the extent that within just a few months he s even been skydiving sharing the photo dr rodriguez joked i can at least check off the box that a face transplant can tolerate jumping out of the air and it all held together i think this photo shows cam is living and doing the things he loves speaking publicly for the first time cam told reporters even though i m still recovering and gaining back some sensation and mobility i m so happy with the results i have a nose and a mouth again so i m able to smile speak and eat solid foods i also don t get as many stares or questions from strangers cam s was the most sophisticated face transplant ever performed with the shortest time between injury and operation despite traveling further than any other patient in history miles across the us transformation cam underwood was when he tried to take his own life with a shotgun while drunk in june and he later could not believe he d done such a thing he lost everything below his eyes but surgeons managed to patch him up left on january he was admitted for a face transplant pictured center shortly after pictured right recently the use of d computer surgical planning d printed patient specific cutting guides intraoperative navigation and intraoperative cat scan ensured that facial bones were aligned perfectly and that implantable plates and screws used to anchor the grafted face to underwood were in an ideal position how was the face transplant done the team at new york university langone medical center worked in two adjoining rooms throughout the hour surgery the team carried out the following transplants maxillary upper jaw and mandibular lower jaw bones including all teeth and gums palate roof of the mouth and floor of the mouth excluding the tongue although underwood s tongue required some reconstruction lower eyelids and cheeks underwood s upper eyelids were preserved nose and sections of the nasal passage during recovery underwood had to undergo rehabilitative therapy this included physical therapy geared toward building strength swallowing and speech therapy occupational therapy psychotherapy advertisement for all of us it s really remarkable to be part of this dr rodriguez said a mother who cried every day finally her prayers were answered and his father too they finally get to see their child whole again nyu langone health is the only center in new york state that can perform face transplants having now performed three and it s one of just a few in the country they were put on the map in august when dr rodriguez operated on patrick hardison who was severely burned while working as a volunteer firefighter in mississippi in september his ears and eyelids were burned off and he had to have more than surgeries to treat his injury hardison s is still the most extensive face transplant that had ever been done but cam s broke new ground technologically it was groundbreaking they used d printing to create the pre surgical structure and align his bones in surgery it was also the first time anyone has used a personalized d printed mask rather than a silicone mold to help shape the patient s face post transplant when we first met cameron we were confident we could improve his appearance and more importantly his function and quality of life rodriguez added advances in medical technology allow us to more rapidly evaluate donors and recipients for face transplant and to perform surgery more safely and efficiently but in the end it s all about the patient cameron has put in the work and has made the necessary commitments it was the shortest time period ever between injury and face transplant just months and despite the extent of cam s injuries which took hours to repair his was the shortest recovery too the fact that he went just months between his injury and his transplant shorter than any other face transplant patient is a huge boost for his recovery dr rodriguez said cameron has not lived with his injury for a decade or longer like most other face transplant recipients have he says as a result he has not had to deal with many of the long term psycho social issues which often lead to issues like severe depression substance abuse and other potentially harmful behaviors it was also a financially groundbreaking insurance covered a significant amount of the surgery rather than research grants which paid for all previous face transplants this is yet another watershed moment in the advancement of face transplantation says g leslie bernstein administrator for the face transplant program at nyu langone health and the principal negotiator with underwood s private insurer securing coverage for cameron s medical care for both his face transplant and his continuing aftercare illustrates how this field is moving closer toward an accepted standard of care lively and relaxed cam didn t hold back as he shared his joy at the press conference at nyu our techniques are improving dr rodriguez pictured right said this facial operation took hours less than the first one he did cam pictured with his family in hospital during his record short recovery before cam had battled with depression for years and was self medicating with alcohol cam s statement good morning and thank you for coming today i m excited to be here with you i think it s important to share my story to help inspire others to have hope and seek help i am so grateful to have received a face transplant which has given me a second chance even though i m still recovering and gaining back some sensation and mobility i m so happy with the results i have a nose and a mouth again so i m able to smile speak and eat solid foods i also don t get as many stares or questions from strangers i ve been able to get back to many of the activities i love like being outdoors playing sports and spending time with my family i hope to get back to work soon too and someday start a family here with me today are my amazing mom and dad along with my brothers and sister and other members of my family they ve been with me every step of the way mom dad julie aaron and brad thank you for not giving up on me it hasn t been easy but it s been worth it i especially want to thank live on new york and will and sally fisher my donor and his mom i want sally and her family to know how much my family and i appreciate their gift and that i will always honor will s legacy i also want to thank dr rodriguez and his amazing team at nyu langone health all of the other doctors nurses therapists staff as well as the assistance we ve received from myface have been incredible everyone has been just amazing in closing i d just like to say that there have been so many amazing advances in transplant surgery i m living proof of that but it only happens because of caring people like will fisher and his family thank you advertisement what happened to cam cam was a welder from yuba city in northern california a small agricultural area north of sacramento he was athletic hard working and a thrifty saver as soon as he graduated high school he got a job working for his stepfather and by he got a mortgage on a house the next few years were rocky though he and his high school sweetheart separated after years together and he lost touch with one of his closest friends which seemed to hit hard one of his brothers he is the youngest of four with two brothers and a sister moved away and he was soon diagnosed with depression he started to drink a lot and recoiled from any of his relatives attempts to get him to ease off at a very young age he decided to become independent dr rodriguez said no one would ever know that there was anything wrong with cameron at all but he was suffering with a little bit of depression often many of us suffer from these bouts and feel that we can overcome it on june he spent the day hitting the bottle something that had become commonplace but that night he entered a vortex that sucked him further than before and he thought he should end his life he pointed a shotgun under his chin and pulled the trigger obliterating his entire face his life as he knew it would forever be changed dr rodriguez said and his family s here they are at the hospital not knowing if he was ever going to live sustained brain injury if he s ever going to see again his mother lived in a trailer in the parking lot of the hospital and spends days with him amazing family by his side every minute of every day dr rodriguez said cam was discharged in february and was home in yuba for the easter holiday he is still on a strict regimen of anti rejection medications and will be for the rest of his life to prevent a rejection episode we are thrilled that cameron is responding so well to the transplant said bruce e gelb md a transplant surgeon at nyu langone our team has established a successful novel patient donor matching protocol and immune suppression regimen that we believe provides the best outcomes for our patients because the risk of rejection and toxicity is greatly minimized underwood remains positive and focused on his new life and is grateful to his donor and the fisher family for what they have done for him will and his family made an incredible sacrifice to give back to me what had been lost he says i will never forget that i m also eternally grateful to dr rodriguez and his face transplant team my family and i could not have made this journey without them we hope my experience inspires others who have severe facial injuries to have hope as i was inspired by others who came before me the journey hasn t been easy but it s been well worth it randy underwood cam s father said cam has always been strong with determination and tenacity and he is sure cam is going to come through this ordeal how doctors saved his life cam was found by his uncle lonnie who d received a text from cam asking him to come over and spend the night lonnie went round straight away i got to his house and all the lights were on which i expected lonnie said door was unlocked i walked in nobody in the living room once he reached the bedroom he discovered blood everywhere and cam struggling very much alive and staggering around lonnie says he went into a state of shock and called cam was airlifted to university of california davis medical center where doctors got to work after numerous surgeries he was stabilized but his face was gone they told us he had no teeth no chin no cheekbones no facial structure nothing his father randy underwood told abc it really wasn t a face it was pretty horrific his brother aaron underwood added at first he was in a medically induced coma then very heavily drugged for just over a month finally in august he was lucid enough to understand what had happened and to see his face for the first time when i woke up i didn t know what was going on where i was what had happened to me he said adding painfully i was shocked that i would actually do something like that and that i had survived cam stayed in the hospital until december once he was discharged he wore a mask all the time finding a face transplant unit and a donor shortly after he was discharged his mother bev heard that surgeons at nyu langone had performed a face transplant on a former firefighter patrick hardison who was maimed by a burning roof that fell on him donor will fisher was a writer filmmaker chess player who studied at johns hopkins university he was described by family as wise beyond his years he died suddenly in january after a battle with mental illness she got in touch and in march dr eduardo rodriguez took him on starting the lengthy procedure to get cam enrolled including physical screening psychiatric screening and counseling and getting him on the transplant list finally in january this year he got the bitter sweet call all transplant hopefuls yearn for they had a candidate will fisher had died in new york city and he was a registered organ donor with liveonny one of the few new yorkers to sign up new york has the lowest proportion of registered organ donors in the country with fewer than percent signed up his mother sally was consulted as doctors found he would be able to transform multiple lives with his heart liver kidneys and eyes to donate his face though the surgeons need more than for him to be signed up to the organ donor registry that required a conversation with his mother sally agreed will described by his family as wise beyond his years was just a bit younger than cam when he died he had the same skin tone skull size hair color a full set of teeth and the same blood type as soon as he received the call cam flew directly to new york from california and that night he underwent the hour surgery that changed his life a team of doctors worked through the night to connect the muscles tissues and blood vessels often people think it s just like putting on a mask it s not that simple dr rodriguez told abc the face needs to fit like a puzzle and that s a tricky thing because we hit the point of no return post surgery rebuilding his life and meeting his donor s mother a face transplant is a life threatening procedure and it s not clear how long one can live after the surgery as far as dr rodriguez knows it may be capped at years cam says he knew all of that but he never saw it as a choice it was his only option to reclaim his life as soon as he saw himself after the procedure he remembers thinking wow that was breathtaking and i was just blown away relieved and excited all at the same time he still battles depression but he has therapy and takes medication i t s not a daily fight anymore but yeah there are still days when i am depressed he said when he first woke up in the hospital he never expected that today two years later he would be eating chatting feeling confident thanks to a face transplant and the incredible heart of sally fisher who agreed to let her son will be a face donor after he died suddenly at the age of following a battle with mental illness cam in the car on his way to meet sally his donor s mother on a manhattan rooftop last month for will s mother sally cam is the one thing that helped her worked through her grief and last month sally and cam met for the first

normal again i mean he looks so fantastic sally turned to cam and added i know you look beautiful i guess i m a little biased i think you re drop dead gorgeous cam now said learning to use his mouth teeth and lips is just like a baby learning to talk i can smile i m working on closing my lips all the way they don t close all the way but they re getting there he said they re a lot better than they were above all he relishes being able to actually eat just to let it sit in your mouth and taste it he said all those little things that we take for granted that you know you miss and you want back dr rodriguez said it was an honor to work with cam and to meet his tight knit family speaking to sally he said he was very grateful he said he hopes sharing his story will deter others from trying to take their lives or to seek help if they experienced a similar situation i just want people to know that it can happen you know that if you re in the same kind of situation that i was in there s people out there that can help you and will you just have to reach out he said his goal now is that i can get back to work and you know eventually i want a family and kids you know the american dream for will s mother sally cam is the one thing that helped her worked through her grief she told people i don t think i would have survived will s death if it wasn t for cameron cameron s got his whole

intriguing new discovery on hair loss in wounded skin could lead us to new treatments scientists think they ve found one of the main reasons hair doesn t grow back on wounded skin based on tests on mice and their research could help develop better hair loss treatments in the future the key is apparently the sonic hedgehog signalling pathway and the proteins its genes encode named for the spiky appearance of its molecules this pathway is very active in the womb when hair follicles are being formed but is noticeably less busy in damaged skin in healthy adults by stimulating communication along the pathway in fibroblast cells the ones that release the collagen protein that gives skin and hair its shape and strength the researchers were able to grow hair on wounded skin in mice with a few weeks and that s a big deal our results show that stimulating fibroblasts through the sonic hedgehog pathway can trigger hair growth not previously seen in wound healing says one of the team cell biologist mayumi ito from nyu langone health if we can get the right skin cells as chatty as they are in their embryonic form we could eventually get hair growing back on skin damaged by scars and burns as well as helping restore hair growth in people who ve gone bald that s still some way off this research has so far worked in mice but we now have a better understanding of the biological processes happening behind the scenes when scarring and collagen buildup is happening naturally in a wound the hope is that the scarring process might eventually be adapted to trigger hair regrowth by changing some of the signals sent between cells in the past reactivating the sonic hedgehog pathway has led to problems with tumour growths so to guard against this the team concentrated on fibroblasts known to promote healing and only those fibroblasts just beneath the skin s surface this is where the hair follicle roots or dermal papillae first appear so in some ways it s like setting up base camp for renewed hair growth you won t be able to go out and buy a magical baldness cure in the near future but we re getting a little closer it s a problem that s being tackled from multiple angles too earlier this year research showed that hair follicle regrowth could be triggered by certain smells too setting off a chemical reaction to stimulate the reappearance of hairs meanwhile last year another team of scientists identified a protein responsible for controlling hair growth and regeneration like this new study the experiments only covered mouse models however mice are a pretty good although not perfect substitute for humans in studies such as this one what we do know is the sonic hedgehog gene is responsible not just for hair follicles but also for limb and organ growth in the womb so it s a fundamental part of how our body develops the next step for the researchers is to find genetic or chemical triggers that could help activate the gene again when it s been knocked out of commission now we know that it s a signalling issue in cells that are very active as we develop in the womb but less so in mature skin cells as we age says ito the research has been published in nature communications,pos
brilliant iron molecule could provide cheaper solar energy the new iron molecule credit nils rosemann for the first time researchers have succeeded in creating an iron molecule that can function both as a photocatalyst to produce fuel and in solar cells to produce electricity the results indicate that the iron molecule could replace the more expensive and rarer metals used today some photocatalysts and solar cells are based on a technology that involves molecules containing metals known as metal complexes the task of the metal complexes in this context is to absorb solar rays and utilise their energy the metals in these molecules pose a major problem however as they are rare and expensive metals such as the noble metals ruthenium osmium and iridium our results now show that by using advanced molecule design it is possible to replace the rare metals with iron which is common in the earth s crust and therefore cheap says chemistry professor kenneth w rnmark of lund university in sweden together with colleagues kenneth w rnmark has for a long time worked to find alternatives to the expensive metals the researchers focused on iron which with its six per cent prevalence in the earth s crust is significantly easier to source the researchers have produced their own iron based molecules whose potential for use in solar energy applications has been proven in previous studies in this new study the researchers have moved one step further and developed a new iron based molecule with the ability to capture and utilise the energy of solar light for a sufficiently long time for it to react with another molecule the new iron molecule also has the ability to glow long enough to enable researchers to see iron based light with the naked eye at room temperature for the first time the good result depends on the fact that we have optimised the molecular structure around the iron atom explains colleague petter persson of lund university the study is now published in the journal science according to the researchers the iron molecule in question could be used in new types of photocatalysts for the production of solar fuel either as hydrogen through water splitting or as methanol from carbon dioxide furthermore the new findings open up other potential areas of application for iron molecules e g as materials in light diodes leds what surprised the lund researchers is that they arrived at good results so quickly in just over five years they succeeded in making iron interesting for photochemical applications with properties largely as good as those of the best noble metals we believed it would take at least ten years says kenneth w rnmark explore further modern alchemy creates luminescent iron molecules more information kasper skov kj r et al luminescence and reactivity of a charge transfer excited iron complex with nanosecond lifetime science journal information science kasper skov kj r et al luminescence and reactivity of a charge transfer excited iron complex with nanosecond lifetime doi science aau,pos

scientists find a way to enhance the performance of quantum computers credit cc public domain usc scientists have demonstrated a theoretical method to enhance the performance of quantum computers an important step to scale a technology with potential to solve some of society s biggest challenges the method addresses a weakness that bedevils performance of the next generation computers by suppressing erroneous calculations while increasing fidelity of results a critical step before the machines can outperform classic computers as intended called dynamical decoupling it worked on two quantum computers proved easier and more reliable than other remedies and could be accessed via the cloud which is a first for dynamical decoupling the technique administers staccato bursts of tiny focused energy pulses to offset ambient disturbances that muck sensitive computations the researchers report they were able to sustain a quantum state up to three times longer than would otherwise occur in an uncontrolled state this is a step forward said daniel lidar professor of electrical engineering chemistry and physics at usc and director of the usc center for quantum information science and technology cqist without error suppression there s no way quantum computing can overtake classical computing the results were published today in the journal physical review letters lidar is the viterbi professor of engineering at usc and corresponding author of the study he led a team of researchers at cqist which is a collaboration between the usc viterbi school of engineering and the usc dornsife school of letters arts and sciences ibm and bay area startup rigetti computing provided cloud access to their quantum computers quantum computers are fast but fragile quantum computers have the potential to render obsolete today s super computers and propel breakthroughs in medicine finance and defense capabilities they harness the speed and behavior of atoms which function radically different than silicon computer chips to perform seemingly impossible calculations quantum computing has the potential to optimize new drug therapies models for climate change and designs for new machines they can achieve faster delivery of products lower costs for manufactured goods and more efficient transportation they are powered by qubits the subatomic workhorses and building blocks of quantum computing but qubits are as temperamental as high performance race cars they are fast and hi tech but prone to error and need stability to sustain computations when they don t operate correctly they produce poor results which limits their capabilities relative to traditional computers scientists worldwide have yet to achieve a quantum advantage the point where a quantum computer outperforms a conventional computer on any task the problem is noise a catch all descriptor for perturbations such as sound temperature and vibration it can destabilize qubits which creates decoherence an upset that disrupts the duration of the quantum state which reduces time a quantum computer can perform a task while achieving accurate results noise and decoherence have a large impact and ruin computations and a quantum computer with too much noise is useless lidar explained but if you can knock down the problems associated with noise then you start to approach the point where

researchers bathed the superconducting qubits with tightly focused timed pulses of minute electromagnetic energy by manipulating the pulses scientists were able to envelop the qubits in a microenvironment sequestered or decoupled from surrounding ambient noise thus perpetuating a quantum state we tried a simple mechanism to reduce error in the machines that turned out to be effective said bibek pokharel an electrical engineering doctoral student at usc viterbi and first author of the study the time sequences for the experiments were exceedingly small with up to pulses spanning up to nanoseconds one billionth of a second or a nanosecond is how long it takes for light to travel one foot for the ibm quantum computers final fidelity improved threefold from percent to percent for the rigetti quantum computer final fidelity improvement was a more modest percent from to according to the study the scientists tested how long fidelity improvement could be sustained and found that more pulses always improved matters for the rigetti computer while there was a limit of about pulses for the ibm computer overall the findings show the dd method works better than other quantum error

new methods could improve expand d imaging using x rays one of the team s computer generated d images of the experimental object using the ghost imaging approach credit andrew kingston and colleagues researchers report two new approaches to producing three dimensional d images using x rays that could improve disease screening study of very fast processes and enable analysis of the properties of materials and structural information of opaque objects with unprecedented detail the researchers describe their approaches to d imaging with x rays in two papers in optica the optical society s journal for high impact research one method might reduce x ray doses needed in some types of preventative medical imaging such as breast cancer screening the other method might allow d imaging of delicate biological samples or the study of very fast processes such as the types of interactions that occur during space debris impacts to speed development of more durable materials because of their high energy and short wavelength x rays can pass through materials that visible light cannot although it is possible to obtain d x ray images current approaches are limited in application because they require prolonged exposures to damaging x rays in humans too much radiation from medical x ray imaging can increase cancer risk which limits how often they can be screened with d mammography and other d x ray technologies very high energy x rays used to study the detailed make up of materials and biological samples often cannot be used because the samples would be destroyed after one exposure d ghost tomography with x rays researchers led by andrew kingston of the australian national university together with a team at the european synchrotron radiation facility esrf in france have demonstrated for the first time that the unconventional imaging approach known as ghost imaging can be used to obtain d x ray images of the interior of objects opaque to visible light because of the potential for significantly lower doses of x rays with d ghost imaging this approach could revolutionize medical imaging by making x ray screening for early signs of disease much cheaper more readily available and able to be undertaken much more often said the paper s senior author david paganin from monash university australia this would greatly improve early detection of diseases including cancers ghost imaging works by correlating two beams in this case x ray beams that do not individually carry any meaningful information about the object one beam encodes a random pattern that acts as a reference and never directly probes the sample the other beam passes through the sample dr andrew kingston in the lab credit anu the researchers created random x ray patterns by shining a bright beam of x ray light through a metal foam which is like a sponge made of metal they took a d image of this random beam and then passed a very weak copy of it through the sample a large area single pixel detector captured x rays that passed through the sample the process was repeated for multiple illuminating patterns and sample object orientations to construct a d tomographic image of the object s internal structure as a proof of concept experiment the researchers carried out ghost x ray tomography on an aluminum cylinder with a diameter of millimeters and containing two holes of less than millimeters diameter they were able to produce d images with million voxels a term for d pixels with a resolution or voxel side length of millionths of a meter x ray ghost imaging especially ghost tomography is a completely new field that needs to be explored and developed much further said kingston with more development we envision ghost x ray tomography as a route to cheaper and therefore much more readily available d x ray imaging machines for medical imaging industrial imaging security screening and surveillance d images from a single exposure a research team from the paul scherrer institute in switzerland led by marco stampanoni together with a team from the deutsches elektronen synchrotron desy in germany and the esrf acquired d images using high brilliance x ray sources their new approach uses a single exposure or shot to obtain d information from x rays one hundred billion times brighter than a hospital x ray source the rays can only be produced at specialized synchrotron facilities the set up for the team s d x ray ghost imaging experiment credit andrew kingston and colleagues high brilliance x ray sources are quite useful for biology and materials science because they can probe faster processes and higher resolutions than other x ray sources said the paper s first author pablo villanueva perez from desy because the power of these sources can destroy the sample after a single pulse current d imaging using the full power of these sources requires multiple identical copies of a sample the new technique can make the measurements necessary to form a d image before destroying the sample so it could be useful for studying the mechanics of delicate biological samples such as living insects or examining the internal d structure of intact viruses or proteins the new single shot approach uses a crystal to split one incoming x ray beam into nine beams that simultaneously illuminate the sample using detectors oriented to record information from each beam allows researchers to acquire at once nine different d projections of a sample object before it is destroyed by the intense x ray probe beams the researchers used the approach to image a moth which demonstrated the potential for studying insect mechanics with d microscale resolution at speeds ranging from microseconds to femtoseconds they also showed that they could achieve nanoscale resolution by imaging a gold nanostructure we would like to combine our technique with the unique capabilities of the european x ray free electron laser facility the first facility to deliver x ray pulses at a rate of one million pulses per second said villanueva perez this could allow d exploration of fast processes at speeds of millions of frames per second the researchers plan to use their single shot multi projection imaging technique to better understand insect biomechanics which could inspire new engineering setups they also want to study new lighter materials that might lower fuel consumption for vehicles and plan to examine the fast processes that occur when space debris hits satellites which could aid development of protective materials explore further innovative sensing technique could improve greenhouse gas analysis,pos
scientists ethicists slam decisions behind gene edited twins as more details regarding the first gene edited humans are released things continue to look worse the researcher who claimed the advance he jiankui has now given a public talk that includes many details on the changes made at the dna level the details make a couple of things clear we don t know whether the editing will protect the two children from hiv infections and we can t tell whether any areas of the genome have been damaged by the procedure all of that raises even further questions as to whether he followed ethical guidelines when performing the work and getting consent from the parents and more generally nobody is sure why he chose to ignore a strong consensus that the procedure wasn t yet ready for use in humans in response to the outcry the chinese government has shut down all further research by he even as it was revealed that a third gene edited baby may be on the way while the us already has rules in place that are intended to keep research like he s from happening a legal scholar ars spoke with suggested there may be a loophole that could allow something similar here in light of that it s important to understand the big picture he has potentially altered what exactly happened in china and why does it concern so many in the scientific community technical failures prior to this work a strong consensus existed among the scientific community that although technology for editing the human genome was available we didn t know enough yet about how to check its safety and effectiveness to determine how to ethically use it and as it turns out he s work appears to provide a demonstration of nearly everything that had the research community concerned researchers at the conference where he spoke provided a transcript of his talk and shared his slides other details have come out via data he s shared with the ap the goal of the editing was to damage the ccr gene which encodes a protein that hiv uses to enter cells during infection he and his colleagues used a gene editing technique that is expected to generate small deletions they targeted one of these deletions to a spot in the center of the gene that s the site of a mutation that blocks hiv infection the data shared so far indicates they were successful in terms of generating deletions but whether or not they inactivated the gene is far less clear advertisement when a gene is translated into a protein its dna is read using a code where three of the bases in dna encode one of the amino acids in a protein this makes a gene very sensitive to whether deletions eliminate a number of bases that s a multiple of three if a deletion takes out six or nine bases for example the resulting protein will only be missing two or three amino acids respectively thus it may be able to function normally if the deletion doesn t remove a multiple of three if it takes out or bases for example then the rest of the gene after the deletion won t be read properly you d end up switching to the protein equivalent of random keyboard bashing often stopping the protein very short in the case of one of the twins born the deletion eliminates base pairs meaning the ccr protein will lack five amino acids but otherwise be normal in the second twin some of her cells will have a four base pair deletion which will cause a short tail of random amino acids other cells will actually have an extra base which also results in a randomization of the amino acids that follow although the tail is much longer in this case the key thing for the twins health and safety is that we have no idea whether any of these proteins will be made and placed on the cell surface as normal and if they are whether hiv can interact with them all of these things can be tested but he has given no indication of whether those tests have been done so we have no idea of whether the edited genes will accomplish the intended goal of blocking hiv infection and worse still it s not clear whether he s team knows quantifying risk or not the fact that one of the two twins has different deletions also points to another worrisome aspect to this work not every cell in the embryo was edited at the same time and in the same manner even though the editing machinery was injected when the embryo was a single cell the resulting embryos could be a mosaic of unedited cells and cells with different types of damage to the intended gene in fact we now know that one of the twins also has some cells where one copy of the gene wasn t edited at all meaning this twin has thus taken on the risks of gene editing without the supposed benefit of hiv protection advertisement this also means we don t know which of these changes if any will be inherited by any kids the twins have the risk of gene editing is that the process sometimes leads to what are called off target effects deletions elsewhere in the genome or more complex rearrangements of the dna either of these could potentially damage or alter genes that are not the intended targets of the editing which would have unpredictable effects on health to check for these he allowed the edited embryos to develop to the point where it was safe to remove several cells the dna from these cells was then sequenced and the sequence compared to that of the two parents unfortunately the techniques that allow sequencing from extremely small samples like this are relatively inefficient as a result he was only able to obtain percent of the genomes of the edited embryos if there was damage in the remaining percentage he didn t know and because of the mosaic nature of the embryos it s not even clear whether the dna sequences he obtained were representative of the remainder of the embryo in the information that was obtained however there was one indication of off target damage yet because it wasn t in the immediate vicinity of a gene he decided that it was acceptable to proceed even though the damage could influence gene activity or chromosome structure in sum the data available so far indicates that we do not know whether the editing will actually protect either of the twins from hiv infection the ostensible goal of the work and as we noted in our original coverage there are other less drastic ways of preventing hiv infections and treatments available if those fail even if gene editing were used it could be used on the blood stem cells that reside in the bone marrow rather than on an embryo at the same time this procedure exposed the twins to risks that we can t fully catalog and don t currently understand as university of wisconsin bioethicist alta charo said having listened to dr he i can only conclude that this was misguided premature unnecessary and largely useless pilar ossorio a bioethics scholar at the university of wisconsin s morgridge institute echoed her concerns he created the risk that these children will suffer from something that they need not have ever suffered from she told ars and we will not get good scientific information out of that,pos
singapore to ban discharge of wash water at top ship refuelling port singapore the maritime port authority mpa said on friday nov that it is banning with effect from jan the discharge of wash water used in ships to scrub engine exhaust the ban on so called open loop scrubbers in singapore home to the world s top ship refuelling or bunkering hub is a potential setback to shippers that have invested millions in the exhaust gas cleaning systems advertisement advertisement the move is to help prepare one of the world s busiest ports for new international maritime organisation imo rules that come into force in and oblige ships to use cleaner fuels to protect the marine environment and ensure that the port waters are clean the discharge of wash water from open loop exhaust gas scrubbers in singapore port waters will be prohibited said andrew tan chief executive officer of the mpa during an event in singapore ships fitted with hybrid scrubbers will be required to switch to the closed loop mode of operation tan said adding that singapore will be providing facilities for the collection of residue generated from the operation of scrubbers the mpa said separately that the ban is already part of our current legislation but that its enforcement would start from jan advertisement advertisement the imo the united nations shipping agency shook the fuels and maritime industries in when it said it would ban ships from using fuels with sulphur content above per cent from jan compared with per cent now to comply with the new rules shippers can switch to burning costlier but cleaner fuels like marine gasoil or low sulphur fuel oil shift to alternative fuels like liquefied natural gas or invest in exhaust gas cleaning systems known as scrubbers open loop scrubbers use seawater as a scrubbing liquid and the waste stream is treated before being discharged back into the sea in closed loop systems scrubbing is performed using water treated with additives and the liquid is recycled back into the scrubber hybrid scrubbers are a combination of both a spate of scrubber installation orders this year has led energy researchers to raise their demand forecasts for high sulphur fuel oil hsfo bunkers as the scrubbers will let the ships continue to burn hsfo once the imo s sulphur regulations go into effect advertisement a switch to low sulphur fuels is still widely seen by industry observers and participants as the most practical form of compliance however given the high investment and operational costs associated with scrubbers and uncertainty around future emissions regulations reporting by roslan khasawneh editing by tom hogue,pos

hope for male pill breakthrough after huge cash injection researchers at a scottish university hope to make a breakthrough in the long hunt for a male pill thanks to a grant of more than that will allow them to screen thousands of existing drugs to see if they have potential the money comes from the bill and melinda gates foundation which has been crusading on family planning for many years with initiatives to help more women in developing countries access the contraception they want to control the size of their family it is now investing in research into a male pill after global studies showing men in many countries would be willing to use it if there were one researchers at dundee university have been given over two years for work at their national phenotypic screening centre they are seeking existing drugs or chemical compounds that can interfere with certain sperm behaviours phenotypes essential for fertility dr paul andrews the director of operations said firstly their ability to swim up the female reproductive tract and secondly a cellular process in the head of the sperm which must happen for the cell to progress towards the egg our screening efforts so far have shown such drugs exist news of the grant was revealed as a team in the us announced a trial of a more traditional approach a hormonal gel men at three sites will use a gel that is absorbed through the skin on their upper arms and shoulders containing the progestin hormone used for female contraception and testosterone as early as the s there was a male contraceptive made out of animal intestines which came with latin instructions to wash in warm milk to avoid infections though today s condoms look a little different and are more widely available the basic sperm blocking concept is the same and it is the only reversible method of male contraception unless you count withdrawal the hunt for a male contraceptive pill has been going on without success since the s when the female pill was invented apart from condoms said chris barratt a professor of reproductive medicine at dundee s school of medicine the reality is we have vasectomy which is irreversible but there is nothing else for men the traditional approach has been to try hormones and steroids to stop sperm production but so far these have not worked well and there are side effects from weight gain to acne people have been more optimistic than they should have been and it has dominated the funding he said the constant disappointments have led to fewer attempts to find an answer the research that has been done on male contraception you could write on a postage stamp said barratt though there has long been the question of men s willingness to use a contraceptive pill and women s willingness to trust them to use it barratt insisted attitudes had changed people are moving away from feeling reproductive health is basically the woman s problem he said research from the world health organization has shown if there was a reversible male contraceptive pill available men would take it andrews said their approach was novel in looking at the behaviour of sperm in infertile patients who may have sperm that do not move or can swim but not penetrate the egg there are profound defects that make them not move or there are defects in the head of the sperm he said we re trying to find drugs to target and immobilise the sperm and stop it getting into the egg melinda and bill gates the billionaire philanthropists have been crusading on family planning for many years photograph reuters we re sort of learning from the genetic defects out there unfortunately there s not a lot known about the genetic causes of infertility we re taking a leaf out of nature s playbook the team will screen whatever drugs and compounds they can find that they think may interfere with the behaviour of sperm such as a library of compounds funded by gates at the university of california which has been a source for potential drugs against neglected tropical diseases if they find nothing in california their technology can screen a plethora of other libraries barratt said i think at the end of two years we will have very good information if there are drugs currently on the market or in the pipeline that could be tweaked for contraception if there are drugs that will be fantastic meanwhile a trial has begun in nine centres around the world including los angeles seattle manchester and edinburgh of a gel that men can apply to their body enabling hormones that will prevent sperm production it follows the trial of two injections every eight weeks commissioned by the world health organization which was successful at preventing pregnancies but was halted in because the side effects caused too many men to drop out the problems included severe acne and mood swings this time dr christina chung lun wang of the los angeles biomedical research institute who is leading the trial sponsored by the national institute of child health and co led by the population council in the us is hopeful men will be more comfortable with the gel researchers will ask participants to complete questionnaires about their well being before and after the trial the men s sexual function must be maintained she said and last time we were not tracking the mood swings prospectively the man must spread ml of gel on his skin he puts it on both upper arms and shoulders it dries quickly but the instructions are that after application he should not be in close skin contact with any other person she said the gel could be rubbed off on to someone else he should shower a few hours afterwards and then he can have contact with family partner or children or he can wear a t shirt they hope to have some answers in about a year researchers were working on a pill she said but it was currently not possible to get the required dose of testosterone into a single daily tablet the challenges to a male contraceptive remain but the quest goes

stimulating one brain area may ease tough to treat depression friday nov healthday news electrical stimulation of a certain part of the brain may offer a new option for treatment resistant depression a small new study suggests researchers at the university of california san francisco found that patients with moderate to severe depression gained significant improvement in their mood after electrical stimulation of a brain region called the orbitofrontal cortex ofc after just three minutes of electrical stimulation to the ofc even on just one side of the brain patients said things like wow i feel better i feel less anxious i feel calm cool and collected ucsf postdoctoral researcher kristin sellers said in a university news release you could see the improvements in patients body language she added they smiled they sat up straighter they started to speak more quickly and naturally the ofc is a small area of the lower surface of the brain located just above the eyes it s exact function remains unclear but study senior author dr eddie chang explained that the ofc is richly connected to various brain structures linked to mood depression and decision making making it very well positioned to coordinate activity between emotion and cognition reporting nov in current biology the ucsf researchers suggested that the targeted therapy might help patients with treatment resistant depression which affects as many as percent of depression patients one neurosurgeon who wasn t involved in the study said brain stimulation therapy for depression isn t new and the field has had some setbacks brain stimulation to treat other conditions such as parkinson s disease has been known for decades to have an effect on the mind noted dr michael schulder he directs neurosurgery at north shore university hospital in manhasset n y several studies over the last years in which depressed patients had implanted brain stimulators initially showed great promise he said in the final analysis however outcomes were not much better than would have been obtained with medication or psychotherapy but could those attempts have been targeting the wrong brain area chang s team wanted to find out their new study involved patients already enrolled in ucsf s epilepsy clinic chang specializes in neurosurgery for people with the seizure disorder he explained that as a routine part of these surgeries patients get electrodes temporarily implanted in their brains to help guide the surgery but in these patients with depression chang s group used feedback from the electrodes to track brain activity over several days they then linked that information to patients changing moods thereby pinpointing brain areas that might be amenable to stimulation therapy that led the investigators to the ofc among other brain areas the researchers would deliver a mild electrical current to brain regions and then ask the patients about their emotional state stimulation to the ofc was the clear winner here in terms of a mood boost what s more stimulating that area seemed to initiate a larger response within the brain similar to what happens naturally when a person is feeling positive also the therapy seemed to only help patients with moderate to severe depression not those with milder forms of the illness according to study team member dr vikram rao this suggests that stimulation was helping patients with serious depression experience something like a naturally positive mood state rather than artificially boosting mood in everyone rao a ucsf health neurologist explained in the news release that prior research had suggested that ofc activity was elevated in people with depression so the stimulation might alter the ofc in a healthy way despite these promising results the study authors said further research in larger groups of patients is needed to determine whether this therapy produces long lasting benefits dr vladan novakovic directs outpatient psychiatry at staten island university hospital in new york city he agreed that most work in electrical brain stimulation has focused on a part of the brain s cortex while leaving other areas such as the ofc unexplored novakovic said the new study is commendable for providing real time clinically relevant information about the state of ofc and improvement in mood for their part the ucsf team believes that an improved understanding of the ofc s role in depression could lead the way to individualized treatment heather dawes who helped to oversee the research said the more we understand about depression at this level of brain circuitry the more options we may have for offering patients effective treatments with a low risk of side effects perhaps by understanding how these emotion circuits go wrong in the first place we can even one day help the brain unlearn depression more information the u s national institute of mental health has more on depression,pos

scientific institution it is located in the city of rio de janeiro where it is installed in the pa o de s o crist v o saint christopher s palace which is inside the quinta da boa vista the main building was originally the residence of the portuguese royal family between and and was later used to house the brazilian imperial family between and after the monarchy was deposed it hosted the republican constituent assembly from to before being assigned to the use of the museum in the building was listed as brazilian national heritage in and was largely destroyed by a fire in founded by king jo o vi of portugal brazil and the algarves on june under the name of royal museum the institution was initially housed at the campo de santana park where it exhibited the collections incorporated from the former house of natural history popularly known as casa dos p ssaros house of the birds created in by the viceroy of brazil lu s de vasconcelos e sousa th count of figueir pt as well as collections of mineralogy and zoology the museum foundation was intended to address the interests of promoting the socioeconomic development of the country by the diffusion of education culture and science in the th century the institution was already established as the most important south american museum of its type in it was incorporated into the federal university of rio de janeiro the national museum held a vast collection with more than million objects one of the largest collections of natural history and anthropological artifacts in the world encompassing some of the most important material records regarding natural science and anthropology in brazil as well as numerous items that came from other regions of the world and were produced by several cultures and ancient civilizations built up over more than two centuries through expeditions excavations acquisitions donations and exchanges the collection was subdivided into seven main nuclei geology paleontology botany zoology biological anthropology archaeology and ethnology the collection was the principal basis for the research conducted by the academic departments of the museum which are responsible for carrying out activities in all the regions of the brazilian territory and several places of the world including the antarctic continent the museum holds one of the largest scientific libraries of brazil with over volumes and rare works in the area of education the museum offers specializations extension and post graduation courses in several fields of the knowledge in addition to hosting temporary and permanent exhibitions and educational activities open to the general public the museum manages the horto bot nico botanical garden adjacent to the pa o de s o crist v o as well as an advanced campus in the city of santa teresa in esp rito santo the santa l cia biological station jointly managed with the museum of biology prof mello leit o a third site located in the city of saquarema is used as a support and logistics center for field activities finally the museum is also dedicated to editorial production outstanding in that field the archivos do museu nacional the oldest scientific journal of brazil continuously published since the palace which housed a large part of the collection was destroyed in a fire on the night of september the building had been called a firetrap by critics who argued the fire was predictable and could have been prevented the fire began in the air conditioning system of the auditorium on the ground floor one of the three devices did not have external grounding there was no individual circuit breaker for each of them and a wire was without insulation in contact with metal in the wake of the fire the ruined edifice was being treated as an archaeological site and undergoing reconstruction efforts with a metallic roof covering a m area including debris in more than pieces of the imperial family s past were found during archaeological works on rio de janeiro zoological garden nearby part of quinta da boa vista among the finds are many items such as fragments of crockery cups plates cutlery horseshoes and even buttons and brooches with imperial coat of arms from military clothing those items were given to the museum after being destroyed by fire the national museum has received donations to the amount of r million in seven months towards rebuilding efforts the financial help is expected more from international influences than from the local brazilian population history edit the former imperial palace that housed the national museum the national museum was officially established by king jo o vi of portugal brazil and the algarves in with the name royal museum in an initiative to stimulate scientific research in the kingdom of brazil then a constituent part of the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves initially the museum housed plant and animal specimens especially birds which caused it to be known by locals n as the house of the birds after the marriage of king jo o vi s eldest son and brazil s first emperor dom pedro i to h i r h archduchess maria leopoldina of austria the museum started to attract some of the greatest european naturalists of the th century such as maximilian zu wied neuwied johann baptist von spix and carl friedrich philipp von martius other european researchers who explored the country such as augustin saint hilaire and the baron von langsdorff contributed to the collections of the royal museum by the end of the th century reflecting the personal preferences of his imperial majesty emperor pedro ii the national museum started to invest in the areas of the anthropology paleontology and archaeology the emperor himself who was an avid amateur scientist and enthusiastic supporter of all branches of science contributed with several of the collections of the art of ancient egypt botanical fossils etc which he acquired during many of his trips abroad in this way the national museum was modernized and became the most important museum of natural history and human sciences of south america edmund roberts visited the museum in noting that the museum only had three open rooms at that time and that the closed rooms were sadly plundered of its contents by don pedro the national museum at its first location in campo de sant anna today s pra a da rep blica ca c sala spix d pedro ii was well aware of the shortage of true scientists and naturalists in brazil he fixed this problem by inviting foreign scientists to come to work at the museum the first to come was ludwig riedel a german botanist who had participated in baron von langsdorff s famed expedition to mato grosso from to other scientists to come were german chemist theodor peckolt and american geologist and paleontologist charles frederick hartt in the following years the museum gradually became known so it continued to attract several foreign scientists who wished to achieve scientific stature with their work in brazil such as fritz m ller hermann von ihering carl august wilhelm schwacke orville adalbert derby mil august goeldi louis couty and others all of them were fired by museum director ladislau netto when the emperor was deposed the emperor was a very popular figure when he was deposed by a military coup in so the republicans tried to erase the symbols of the empire one of these symbols the pa o de s o crist v o the official residence of the emperors in the quinta da boa vista became vacant therefore in the national museum with all its collections valuables and researchers was transferred to this palace where it stays until today in the museum s management was passed to the university of brazil currently the federal university of rio de janeiro the researchers and their offices and laboratories occupy a good part of the palace and other buildings erected at botanical gardens horto florestal in the quinta da boa vista park one of the largest scientific libraries of rio the national museum offers graduate courses in the following areas anthropology sociology botany geology paleontology and zoology it was presented as a lego idea former collections edit the museum sheltered one of the largest exhibits of the americas prior to the fire consisting of animals insects minerals aboriginal collections of utensils egyptian mummies and south american archaeological artifacts meteorites fossils and many other findings one of the meteorites that was on display is the bendeg meteorite which weighs over kilograms lb and was discovered in archaeology edit the collection of archaeology of the national museum comprised more than objects covering distinct several civilizations that lived in the americas europe africa and the middle east since the paleolithic age until the th century the collection is subdivided into four main segments ancient egypt mediterranean cultures pre columbian archaeology and pre columbian brazil last nucleus

the institution and recalls that his survival is tied to the responsibility of those who hold power in the hands the document was also sent to the national congress where he had regularly gone to ask for a public hearing during which he asked for the inclusion of resources for the museum and for the next budget without these resources he says the institution will end up harming decades of research in the letter the director says that many reflect on what could have been done differently to avoid a disaster that led to the loss of an invaluable patrimony involving millions of cultural and scientific pieces he also adds that others should be deeply reflecting on why being in a position of decision they did not act firmly in triggering actions that would have avoided the absurdity of

republican controlled legislature that took collective bargaining rights away from public employee unions in a effort to close the state s budget gap tens of thousands of demonstrators opposing walker

tonight to win is a substantial defeat for labor for public employee unions and a substantial defeat a substantial victory for those who have been trying to curb them public opinion polls leading up to the vote had shown walker holding a narrowing lead and early exit polls suggested the race would be tight with of those responding identifying themselves as democrats saying they re republicans and saying they re independents a state official said on condition of not being identified that turnout appeared to be strong with reports of some polling places running out of forms for same day voter registration the race was a rematch of the governor s contest won by walker with only of the vote but this time the stakes were higher just watched obama skipping wisconsin recall vote replay more videos must watch obama skipping wisconsin recall vote just watched wisconsin recall dry run for november replay more videos must watch wisconsin recall dry run for november the first term governor s win could give republicans a major boost in efforts to make wisconsin a battleground state in the november presidential election it now has a strong ground operation in a state that has been remained blue since but exit polls indicate that the vote tuesday wasn t the presidential litmus test that many pundits suggested while barrett went down to defeat those responding to exit polls favored president barack obama over gop presumptive presidential nominee mitt romney by a margin and obama got higher marks than romney on handling the economy by a slim margin and on helping the middle class by a wider margin obama easily won the state in but walker s unyielding commitment to fiscal austerity in the face of chaotic protests last year made him the poster child for tea party conservatism walker would have been only the third governor in u s history ousted by a recall election along with the gubernatorial recall lt gov rebecca kleefisch also won her recall election four republican senators also faced recall votes tuesday but results were not yet available a loss of any of those four races would have tipped control of the senate to democrats but with the legislature out of session until after the general election a democratic win would have provided mostly a moral victory a former republican state senator ousted in a wisconsin recall vote last year said tuesday that the political wound he suffered was worth it because of the fiscal austerity achieved i lost my job standing for something and i was standing for the people fiscal responsibility and the future of this country and the state and its residents dan kapanke said adding that the times dictate tough decisions and we want our elected officials to do the right thing and worry about the future and not just about the next election walker complains that repeated recall efforts over past years are stalling progress and costing the state needed money earlier tuesday barrett said he agrees that voters are tired of recall politics but he blamed walker for creating a divisive political environment that inspired the effort to oust him what gov walker doesn t say is he was the one who these are his words dropped the bomb and attempted to divide and conquer so he set out on a strategy to divide this state he succeeded in dividing the state barrett said adding that the proper course now is to get rid of the instigator rather than to allow him to continue because i think this state will remain this bitterly divided if he continues in office about million has been spent on the race since november an analysis from the center for public integrity found that s a state record shattering the record of million spent during the governor s race walker collected million to barrett s million roughly two thirds of walker s contributions came from out of state the center for public integrity reported while only a quarter of barrett s funds originated from outside wisconsin barrett said tuesday that such outside influence is a change for wisconsin what s happened is scott walker has become the rock star of the far right and has been able to raise literally millions of dollars from out of state contributors barrett said during a bitter fight over the law last year democratic legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum and tens of thousands of protesters converged on the state capitol building in what became an occupation after the law was signed democrats immediately began a recall effort that led to tuesday s vote walker has defended his budget actions as necessary for the fiscal health of his state and described his campaign as one of a strong leader who is making the necessary tough decisions the campaign has been fierce with campaigners complaining of keyed cars verbal harassment and a general lack of tolerance for differing opinions we have an example of hatfields and mccoys going on in this state like we have never seen said brian nemoir a milwaukee based republican strategist people are hyper engaged as much in support for their own candidate as in disgust for the opponent handmade signs were nearly as prevalent as official ones some locals say they have resorted to lowering their voices in public when discussing the recall to avoid setting off arguments with strangers the justice department on monday dispatched federal observers to monitor milwaukee polling places tuesday to ensure that no voter discrimination took place a litany of republican stars have campaigned for walker including fellow governors chris christie of new jersey nikki haley of south carolina bobby jindal of louisiana and bob mcdonnell of virginia as well as u s sen marco rubio from florida while romney didn t campaign for walker in wisconsin he quickly congratulated the governor after his victory governor walker has demonstrated over the past year what sound fiscal policies can do to turn an economy around and i believe that in november voters across the country will demonstrate that they want the same in washington d c romney said in a statement americans for prosperity a conservative advocacy group built around many of the same principles as the tea party has pumped more than million into wisconsin backing walker s policies barrett meanwhile got his own high powered support from former president clinton as well as democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz and maryland gov martin o malley however his campaign fund raising has badly trailed the support walker received the progressive change campaign committee announced saturday that it was spending in the five days before the wisconsin recall vote bringing its investment to obama never came to wisconsin to campaign for barrett which republicans surmised was because the president believes barrett will lose on sunday barrett said on cnn s state of the union that his campaign never asked obama to appear on his behalf adding that we understand he s got a lot going on white house press secretary jay carney acknowledged the uniqueness of the contest while stressing there s no doubt where the president stood the president s made clear all along his opposition to those who would take away workers rights to actions that would take away or diminish worker s rights carney said and he s also made clear his support for tom barrett four republican senators also faced recall votes tuesday but results were not yet available a loss of any of those four races would have tipped control of the senate to democrats but with the legislature out of

texas has highest maternal mortality rate in developed world study finds the rate of texas women who died from complications related to pregnancy doubled from to a new study has found for an estimated maternal mortality rate that is unmatched in any other state and the rest of the developed world the finding comes from a report appearing in the september issue of the journal obstetrics and gynecology that the maternal mortality rate in the united states increased between and even while the rest of the world succeeded in reducing its rate excluding california where maternal mortality declined and texas where it surged the estimated number of maternal deaths per births rose to in from in or about but the report singled out texas for special concern saying the doubling of mortality rates in a two year period was hard to explain in the absence of war natural disaster or severe economic upheaval from to the end of texas s estimated maternal mortality rate hovered between and per births but after that rate had leaped to deaths per and in it was between and more than women died for reasons related to their pregnancies no other state saw a comparable increase in the wake of the report reproductive health advocates are blaming the increase on republican led budget cuts that decimated the ranks of texas s reproductive healthcare clinics in just as the spike began the texas state legislature cut m from the state s family planning budget of m the two thirds cut forced more than family planning clinics to shut down across the state the remaining clinics managed to provide services such as low cost or free birth control cancer screenings and well woman exams to only half as many women as before at the same time texas eliminated all planned parenthood clinics whether or not they provided abortion services from the state program that provides poor women with preventive healthcare previously planned parenthood clinics in texas offered cancer screenings and contraception to more than women in texas restored funding for the family planning budget to original levels but the healthcare providers who survived the initial cuts reported struggles to restore services to their original levels indeed the report said it was puzzling that texas s maternal mortality rate rose only modestly from to before doubling between and the researchers hailing from the university of maryland boston university s school of public health and stanford university s medical school called for further study but they noted that starting in texas drastically reduced the number of women s health clinics within its borders the report comes just as public health advocates are raising questions about texas s ability to prepare for the zika virus which is transmitted by a common species of mosquito and has been linked to severe birth defects the world health organization has advised women in areas of local transmission to delay pregnancy texas is one of several southern states where health officials say there is a risk of a local outbreak but about half the state lacks ready access to ob gyn care making it difficult for women to obtain contraception or for pregnant women to confirm the health of their babies just this month texas s health department drew fire for allocating m of the m the state budgets for low income women s family planning to an anti abortion group that does not provide basic health services there is a need to redouble efforts to prevent maternal deaths and improve maternity care for the million us women giving birth each year the authors said,neg

climate change human disaster looms claims new research some of the most extreme predictions of global warming are unlikely to materialise new scientific research has suggested but the world is still likely to be in for a temperature rise of double that regarded as safe the researchers said warming was most likely to reach about c above pre industrial levels if the past decade s readings were taken into account that would still lead to catastrophe across large swaths of the earth causing droughts storms floods and heatwaves and drastic effects on agricultural productivity leading to secondary effects such as mass migration some climate change sceptics have suggested that because the highest global average temperature yet recorded was in climate change has stalled the new study which is published in the journal nature geoscience shows a much longer pause would be needed to suggest that the world was not warming rapidly alexander otto at the university of oxford lead author of the research told the guardian that there was much that climate scientists could still not fully factor into their models he said most of the recent warming had been absorbed by the oceans but this would change as the seas heat up the thermal expansion of the oceans is one of the main factors behind current and projected sea level rises the highest global average temperature ever recorded was in under the effects of a strong el ni o a southern pacific weather system associated with warmer and stormy weather which oscillates with a milder system called la ni a since then the trend of average global surface temperatures has shown a clear rise above the long term averages the warmest years on record have been since but climate sceptics have claimed that this represents a pause in warming otto said that this most recent pattern could not be taken as evidence that climate change has stopped given the noise in the climate and temperature system you would need to see a much longer period of any pause in order to draw the conclusion that global warming was not occurring he said such a period could be as long as years of the climate record he said otto said the study found that most of the climate change models used by scientists were pretty accurate a comprehensive global study of climate change science is expected to be published in september by the intergovernmental panel on climate change its first major report since jochem marotzke professor at the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg and a co author of the paper said it is important not to over interpret a single decade given what we know and don t know about natural climate variability over the past decade the world as a whole has continued to warm but the warming is mostly in the subsurface oceans rather than at the surface other researchers also warned that there was little comfort to be taken from the new estimates greenhouse gas emissions are rising at a far higher rate than had been predicted by this stage of the st century and set to rise even further so estimates for how much warming is likely will also have to be upped richard allan reader in climate at the university of reading said this work has used observations to estimate earth s current heating rate and demonstrate that simulations of climate change far in the future seem to be pretty accurate however the research also indicates that a minority of simulations may be responding more rapidly towards this overall warming than the observations indicate he said the effect of pollutants in the atmosphere which reflect the sun s heat back into space was particularly hard to measure he noted the inferred sensitivity of climate to a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations based on this new study suggesting a rise of c to c was consistent with the range from climate simulations of c to c he said with work like this our predictions become ever better,neg
tar sands exploitation would mean game over for climate warns leading scientist major international oil companies are buying off governments according to the world s most prominent climate scientist prof james hansen during a visit to london he accused the canadian government of acting as the industry s tar sands salesman and holding a club over the uk and european nations to accept its dirty oil oil from tar sands makes sense only for a small number of people who are making a lot of money from that product he said in an interview with the guardian it doesn t make sense for the rest of the people on the planet we are getting close to the dangerous level of carbon in the atmosphere and if we add on to that unconventional fossil fuels which have a tremendous amount of carbon then the climate problem becomes unsolvable hansen met ministers in the uk government which the guardian previously revealed has secretly supported canada s position at the highest level canada s natural resources minister joe oliver has also visited london to campaign against eu proposals to penalise oil from alberta s tar sands as highly polluting canada can offer energy security and economic stability to the world he said oliver also publicly threatened a trade war via the world trade organisation if the eu action went ahead canada will not hesitate to defend its interests the lobbying for and against tar sands has intensified on both sides of the atlantic as the eu moves forward on its proposals which canada fears could set a global precedent and barack barack obama considers approving the keystone xl pipeline to transport tar sands oil from canada to the us gulf coast refineries and ports canada s prime minister stephen harper was met by protesters when he visited new york last week to tell audiences that kxl absolutely needs to go ahead canada s tar sands are the third biggest oil reserve in the world but separating the oil from the rock is energy intensive and causes three to four times more carbon emissions per barrel than conventional oil hansen argues that it would be game over for the climate if tar sands were fully exploited given that existing conventional oil and gas is certain to be burned to leave our children with a manageable situation we need to leave the unconventional fuel in the ground he said canada s ministers were acting as salesmen for those people who will gain from the profits of that industry he said but i don t think they are looking after the rights and wellbeing of the population as a whole the thing we are facing overall is that the fossil fuel industry has so much money that they are buying off governments hansen said our democracies are seriously handicapped by the money that is driving decisions in washington and other capitals the eu aims to penalise oil sources with higher carbon footprints as part of a drive to reduce the carbon emissions from transport called the fuel quality directive fdq but canada supported by the uk is fiercely opposed we are not saying they should not move to reduce emissions said oliver but the proposed implementation of the fqd is discriminatory to oil sands and not based on scientific facts however europe s commissioner for climate action connie hedegaard said the fqd was nothing more nothing less than accurate labelling and putting a fair price on pollution hansen who informed the us congress of the danger of global warming in has caused controversy before by saying the ceos of fossil fuel companies should be tried for high crimes against humanity and calling coal fired power plants factories of death in april he stepped down from his nasa position after years in order to spend more time communicating the risks of climate change and to work on legal challenges to governments hansen has started a science programme at columbia university the first task of which is to produce a report to support suits filed again the us federal government and several state governments it is being pursued by the our children s trust charity and is based on a trust principle recognised in us law we maintain that the atmosphere and climate are held in trust by the present generations for the future generations and we do not have the right to destroy that asset hansen said therefore the courts should require the government to give a plan as to how they are going to ensure that we still have that asset to pass on to the next generation,neg

air pollution everything you should know about a public health emergency why is air pollution a fast growing concern nothing is more vital to life than breathing in a lifetime about m litres of air passes through your lungs yet walk along a busy city street and you will inhale something like m particles in a single lungful toxic air is now the biggest environmental risk of early death responsible for one in nine of all fatalities it kills million people a year far more than hiv tuberculosis and malaria combined for example dr maria neira the world health organisation director with responsibility for air pollution is blunt it is a global public health emergency how much does it cost us the lost lives and ill health caused are also a colossal economic burden bn in lost labour income in or tn per year about m a minute if welfare losses are added in according to a world bank report which called the figure a sobering wake up call air pollution is getting worse in the developing world and while it is getting better in some developed nations our knowledge of how comprehensively it damages our bodies and minds is growing even faster dirty air has been with us for centuries previously we simply lived with it and no one has yet had air pollution as a cause of death on their death certificate it is only in recent decades that the damage to health has become clear and in recent years that the health crisis has received widespread attention thanks to research revelations government legal defeats and the volkswagen diesel scandal but there is a silver lining to air pollution s cloud of smog action to cut it not only brings immediate benefits but also helps fight climate change in the longer term who does it affect almost everyone over off the world s population lives in places where air pollution is above who guidelines it is worst in south and east asia where most of humanity lives with traffic dirty industry and the open burning of waste delivering a triple whammy india has almost half of the top most polluted cities in the world china has eight and iran has three africa is highly polluted but little measured in paris had three times more monitoring stations than the entire continent but air pollution still affects rich nations too the trends are positive if we look at the last years but it depends how many deaths are you ready to accept says neira we still have deaths in europe per year and this is totally unacceptable children s developing bodies are uniquely vulnerable but million live in places with extreme air pollution where toxic fumes are six times higher than international guidelines are there different types of air pollution yes the most damaging but best understood are tiny particles these not only damage the lungs but enter the bloodstream they are increasingly thought to enter vital organs including the brain and have been shown the reach the liver spleen kidneys and testes in lab animals the particles can be made of black carbon nitrates sulphates ammonia or mineral dust most are produced by burning fossil fuels or wood for driving heating power plants and industry while improvements have been made in some countries for example to coal fired power stations and cars other sources have lagged behind farming is one such source of pollution with ammonia from livestock manure and fertilisers blowing into cities and forming particles particularly in spring time when crops are sown and muck is spread nitrogen dioxide produced by diesel vehicles not only forms particles but is now known to cause harm when breathed as a gas it is still illegally high in much of urban britain for example where it results in about early deaths other pollutants include sulphur dioxide which is usually stripped out of vehicle fuels but still very high in ship and aviation fuels ground level ozone which forms on sunny days harms people but also crops of the global wheat crop is estimated to be lost in india crop yields are reduced by by ozone there are some natural sources of outdoor air pollution such as dust storms and smoke from forest fires but human caused pollution far exceeds these outdoor air pollution causes million early deaths according to the who what about indoors this is also a huge killer causing million early deaths some people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor pollution half the world s population cook on open fires with dirty fuels such as wood dung and charcoal and kerosene in wick lamps also produces dangerous smoke more people are getting access to better fuels and stoves among farmers in xuanwei in china for example cases of lung cancer fell by when they switched to stoves with chimneys in their homes but with the global population rising the number of people exposed to indoor pollution is not falling what harm does air pollution do increasingly it is easier to ask what harm does air pollution not do research is now linking toxic air not only to almost every part of the body but also to the mind the dangers of toxic air are a surprisingly recent discovery the landmark research linking air pollution to lung diseases heart attacks and strokes the harvard six cities study was first published in since then dirty air has been linked to many other conditions such as diabetes air pollution contributed to m new cases of this illness in according to one study kidney disease appears to be influenced by air pollution as does alzheimer s disease the skin is affected too ageing more rapidly in dirty air the research on babies and children is particularly worrying a large recent study found toxic air significantly increases the risk of low birth weight leading to lifelong damage to health the doctors involved called this finding alone something approaching a public health catastrophe millions of premature births may be linked to air pollution another study makes the connection to birth defects and another to cot deaths the first direct evidence of pollution particles in mothers placentas has also been revealed it is a worrying problem there is a massive association between air pollution a mother breathes in and the effect it has on the foetus said the lead researcher as children grow asthma and stunted lung growth is a serious issue linked to air pollution as is the ability to learn in school and the risk of teenage delinquency the estimated annual death toll of million is certain to be an underestimation as it only includes particle pollution and the five most firmly linked causes of death such as heart attacks early estimates using improved models suggest a total figure of million from particle pollution but even this is only the tip of the iceberg of harm according to researchers that is because the ubiquitous exposure to air pollution is likely to damage the health of almost everyone in some way even if it doesn t lead to a visit to the doctor the who is clear the burden of disease from outdoor air pollution is expected to greatly increase can i protect myself the rise of concern over air pollution has prompted a plethora of protection products masks are now commonly advertised but experts say they are of limited use unless they have an airtight seal on the face which is rare giant towers street side benches and living green walls have all been proposed to filter dirty air a new bus aims to filter the air in southampton uk as it travels trees can help too unless they block the breezes that blow pollution away in which case they make things worse other suggestions are pollution monitoring apps so people can choose to avoid the worst times and alternative city walking routes that keep pedestrians away from the filthiest roads people in cars are often exposed to more pollution than those outside as fumes become trapped in the cabin closing the air circulation in your car before hitting the city centre is certainly a good idea there is also some evidence that omega oils and vitamin b may offer some protection against the damage caused by air pollution isn t that treating the symptom not the cause yes the only practical way to tackle the global health emergency is to cut levels of pollution at source there is an ethical angle too says dr gary fuller at kings college london morally it is not right to make the victims change their behaviour instead of the culprits poorer people are also most exposed to air pollution there are huge injustices at the heart of the air pollution problem says fuller by using our air to dispose of their waste polluters are destroying a shared resource and avoiding the full cost of their actions what next the solutions are simultaneously perfectly possible and incredibly hard because they require little new technology but involve action across many areas and are usually neither politically palatable yet or very profitable to implement there are two big transitions we need to have says neira one is a healthy energy transition and the other is the healthy urban planning transition we need to stop the use of coal to stop the massive use of private cars in cities and make our buildings more efficient coal burning is declining globally and china has shown how industrial pollution can be rapidly curbed particle pollution is down by a third just four years after a war on pollution was declared and eight after beijing s air was labelled crazy bad when pollution leapt off the charts but cities around the world are expanding rapidly with billion urban dwellers set to swell to billion by how those expanded cities are constructed is vital say experts like fuller we will pay a heavy price if we get it wrong now mobility should focus on walking cycling and public transport even electric vehicles throw up particle pollution from road abrasion and brake dust the remaining cars and lorries need to be set and stick to much stricter pollution controls buildings ought to be heated and cooled using renewable energy and waste should not be burned without stringent controls progress is being made in some places some dutch and danish towns have turned their back on cars and seoul in south korea has demolished expressways in favour of bus lanes and a new river but some motoring lobbies and car manufacturers remain obstacles to citizens breathing clean air neira a former health minister in spain says politicians should play the health card to win the argument if you reduce cases of asthma everybody will love it other reasons for action are the climate change benefits of cutting coal oil and gas burning and the reduction in obesity that follows more active travel such as cycling what must be done to end the air pollution emergency is not the issue says neira it is the lack of serious

wind turbines acting as apex predators by driving down bird numbers study finds wind turbines can act as top predators in ecosystems by driving down populations of birds and triggering knock on effects across food chains according to a new study scientists found that predatory raptor birds were four times rarer in parts of an indian mountain range covered in wind turbines suggesting they were avoiding the structures the same areas saw an explosion in numbers the raptors prey fan throated lizards which also became more confident and less scared of humans due to the lack of predation we have basically added a new apex predator a wind turbine dr maria thaker from the indian institute of science in bengaluru told the independent what that predator does is remove the level below it not kill it but the outcome is the same these cascading effects on ecosystems suggest that care should be taken to ensure that wind turbines do not have dangerous and far reaching consequences for nature scientists have become increasingly aware of the impact these massive structures can have on wildlife with studies showing birds and bats can be killed or scared away by their spinning blades

transition away from fossil fuels to reduce the impact of climate change experts say there is a need to establish a compromise and ensure turbines are built in areas with the lowest impact possible the bottom line for me is that i will pick wind energy over fossil fuels any day said dr thaker we just have to be smart about where we put them so can we minimise our impact on the ecosystem by picking areas that are not unique in ways that we cannot replace she suggested putting wind turbines in places that we have already disrupted such as on top of buildings and said there must be a dialogue between ecologists and the renewables industry recommended wind power overtakes nuclear in uk for first time dr thaker s findings were published in the journal nature ecology evolution in the uk the rspb has examined the issue of wind farms and concluded this kind of strategic approach is required to ensure that harm is kept to a minimum while noting that climate change poses the single greatest long term threat to our wildlife they say wind farms should be located away from major migration routes and important feeding breeding and roosting areas of vulnerable bird species wind farms while they have a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change must be built in the right places so they don t harm bird populations said dr aly mccluskie a conservation scientist at the rspb in places such as the north sea we are beginning to see an unprecedented industrialisation of the marine environment the cumulative effects of ever more poorly sited wind farms are likely to have dire consequences for our seabirds adding to the pressures from a changing climate,neg

emaciated population desperately need food medicine and supplies and more than per cent of it is fed into yemen through the crucial red sea port but the fighting in hodeida home to more than million people is far from over in fact despite calls from the us two weeks ago to end the chaos engulfing the dirt poor country the fighting has just intensified dramatically the sunni muslim saudis are

teacher with criminal history arrested after altercation with student rcmp have arrested a halifax area teacher accused of assault and mischief after an oct incident involving a student derek william stephenson an english teacher at cole harbour district high school was arrested nov and is scheduled to appear in dartmouth provincial court on dec rcmp said in a news release tuesday no charges have yet been laid stephenson is currently on administrative leave and has voluntarily surrendered his teaching licence the halifax regional centre for education said in a statement today an altercation occurred when the man removed ear buds from a year old youth s ears the rcmp release says the youth then removed the man s lanyard that was attached to keys in his pants pocket the man then pushed the youth into a wall and put him on the floor the boy reported the incident to the school administration he was then checked by emergency health services but wasn t found to have any injuries the rcmp were called to the school and investigated reached by phone on tuesday stephenson declined comment i have been instructed not to speak to the media he said thank you very much criminal history known by administrators the administration at the halifax area high school knew that stephenson had a criminal history involving threats and domestic violence and had vouched for his character with justice officials following at least one of his earlier encounters with the law the oct incident happened in a classroom and a four second video recorded by another student has been circulating on the social media app snapchat where a man is seen kneeling and briefly putting a student in a choke hold the latest incident is raising questions about what halifax area education officials beyond the school knew of the criminal charges stephenson previously faced while he was a teacher and what measures if any were taken that past includes pleading guilty in october to threatening his ex girlfriend who is a teacher at another school and a november guilty plea for assaulting his ex wife a case in which a charge of assaulting his daughter was withdrawn in a woman also got an emergency protection order against him derek william stephenson an english teacher at cole harbour district high school is shown in this image from a cbc story about a school rap performance on nov he was arrested and is scheduled to appear in dartmouth provincial court next month following an altercation with a student in the classroom cbc nancy jakeman a former member of the halifax regional school board said elected members were never told about those cases it s something that now strikes her as an unsettling lack of transparency and accountability given board members were typically informed when other teachers faced charges it definitely bothers me jakeman said in an interview it raises concerns the fact that it wasn t brought forth to the board i just don t agree with that i think that it should have been it also doesn t sit well with the family of the year old student stephenson is accused of assaulting the student s older brother said in an interview that the teen told him the incident started after stephenson ripped out the student s earphones the older brother who is an adult and was not present said his younger brother told him he then touched stephenson s lanyard the teacher began to taunt the teen he said and then charged at him and tackled him shoving the boy against the wall if you have somebody that has assault charges and then you let them work at the school and then they assault somebody again that s really a bad decision on their part the older brother said of school officials cbc news has decided not to identify the student due to his age the assault allegation has not been proven in court while stephenson has previously been found guilty of crimes court documents and audio recordings of past court proceedings show how glowing references including at least one from a school administrator have helped him avoid a criminal record in stephenson was arrested outside cole harbour district high school and charged with assaulting his now ex wife and their daughter at a dartmouth n s home he pleaded guilty that november to assaulting his wife the court was told he grabbed her by the hair and pushed her he was handed months of probation and ordered to attend an intimate partner violence prevention program he received a conditional discharge which meant he had been found guilty but would not have a criminal record after three years so long as he completed probation without a problem vice principal part of glowing report for court the then vice principal at cole harbour high barrett khan provided a character reference for stephenson s pre sentence report describing his creative dedication to working with students on initiatives including producing videos spoken word musicals and building a haunted house stephenson was arrested outside cole harbour district high school in and charged with assaulting his now ex wife and their daughter at a dartmouth n s home craig paisley cbc at sentencing crown and defence lawyers agreed the pre sentence report especially khan s reference led them to a joint recommendation of a conditional discharge because the assault appeared to be out of character defence lawyer geoff newton highlighted to the judge stephenson s work with students at the school and the glowing nature of the pre sentence report arguing he should not be sent to jail crown prosecutor perry borden noted the vice principal at his school spoke very highly of him and his abilities judge alana murphy granted stephenson the discharge she ordered a dna sample be taken from him in court again years later in october stephenson also received a conditional discharge for mischief and threatening his ex girlfriend a charge of assaulting her was withdrawn he was put on probation and ordered to take anger management courses and to stay away from his ex girlfriend following his arrest on those charges a fellow teacher at cole harbour peter mahalik acted as his surety to secure his release the crown noted at sentencing a positive pre sentence report he said stephenson had been candid about his anger management problems and had lost his temper in the course of a domestic dispute defence lawyer michelle james said it was in her client s best interest to remain criminal record free given the nature of his employment in granting the conditional discharge judge jean whalen said if you re asked whether you ve been found guilty of a criminal offence you have to say yes because i have to find you guilty before i impose sentence if you re asked do you have a criminal record you can say no because a conditional discharge is not a criminal record what anybody does with that information i have no control over mr stephenson safety of students a priority principal following the incident at the school last month students in the classroom went to the school s office to report what happened the boy s brother said in a message sent home from the school on the day of the incident principal dunovan kalberlah said the staff member has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the investigation the safety of our students is always a top priority kalberlah wrote doug hadley halifax regional centre for education spokesperson would not speak to the incident or to stephenson s employment history describing it as a confidential personnel matter the hrce is responsible for administering the region s schools it was created on april after the provincial government dissolved all elected school boards in favour of an appointed advisory council hadley would also not confirm if education officials received any reports about stephenson s criminal history or what action was taken in response i can say that the hrce takes any matter potentially impacting the safety and security of our students very seriously and we take all reasonable measures to ensure their safety is protected at all times while under our supervision hadley said in an email to cbc news last month volunteers need regular police checks school volunteers must clear a police background check and a check of the province s child abuse registry every three years according to hrce policy however teachers only require a background check when hired unless they break service longer than three months during the school year according to the hrce student protection policy stephenson would not have passed a criminal record check and a vulnerable sector check until three years after pleading guilty according to const john macleod a halifax regional police spokesperson after being hired if a teacher is under a criminal investigation it is their duty to report that to the hrce said hadley there is no specific hrce policy stating which crimes would be grounds for dismissal if an employee was convicted of a crime our human resources

alongside earth s angstiest superheroes in the high grossing marvel blockbusters of the past decade but stan lee who died monday aged was far more than that it s no stretch to say that he helped redraw the world of american fiction and he certainly made sure everyone knew it from the ashes of pulp magazines and the radioactive raw material of postwar uncertainty about science and power he summoned not singlehandedly but certainly without parallel or peer a textured self sustaining universe of imperfect heroes while updike and cheever were doing it in literature while kubrick and lumet and penn were doing it at the movies the father of marvel presented comic book america which meant at the time mostly adolescent boys with a pantheon of deeply flawed protagonists who despite their

the villains apart sort of like real life this was in no small measure due to lee the son of jewish immigrants who as marvel s editor in chief wrote many of the books himself during comics silver age years of the early s with seemingly boundless energy and a staggering variety of voices he breathed personality ambiguity and a common narrative into soon to be beloved characters one of the things we try to demonstrate in our yarns is that nobody is all good or all bad lee wrote in a column for marvel s march issues even a shoddy super villain can have a redeeming trait just as any howlin hero might have his nutty hang ups it s hard to overestimate how groundbreaking this philosophy was in a nation that with a tone set by production code hollywood since the early s had spent three decades positioning largely unambiguous heroes at the center of its rising mass culture add government efforts in the s to demonize comics as the mind decayers of america s youth and to push publishers back toward pablum and you ll have some idea what lee accomplished at the beginning of the s suddenly here was tony stark a genius inventor with daddy issues and we would eventually learn an alcoholic narcissist who fixed his literally broken heart by turning himself into iron man here was peter parker a meek high school nerd who had no clue how to handle the creepy abilities and hormonal changes bestowed upon him by the bite of a radioactive spider on a class field trip talk about playing to your target audience here was bruce banner a military scientist who tried to save someone from one of his test blasts and ended up locked in a battle with his own angry destructive id hardly an incidental narrative in an era when psychotherapy and self help were sharply on the rise and here was matt murdock blinded in a horrible accident by irradiated waste proving every night with precision radar powers as daredevil that disability isn t necessarily destiny and here were the x men mutants and perpetual outsiders whose struggle to find a place in the mainstream on earth has been variously framed as a parable for race relations anti semitism and the red scare even steve rogers whose captain america was the most superman like of the bunch had demons he was the skinny kid rejected by his world war ii draft board who wanted so badly to fight that he volunteered to be a guinea pig for a supersoldier serum that would turn him into the ultimate fighting machine captain america debuted during the war years when marvel was still called timely comics but lee and his team updated the story for the s by giving rogers even more ghosts he lay frozen in ice for nearly two decades after falling into the sea and awakened out of time in a fast changing morally murky world he barely recognized or could navigate there was another less noticed corner where lee was equally groundbreaking as marvel s editor in an age before computers were in every pocket he worked tirelessly to develop a relationship with his audience he talked about stuff behind the scenes and curated a tallish tale of a wacky collegial studio of writers and artists who might do just about anything in their pursuit of good stories his regular column stan s soapbox talked directly to readers in a way that presaged the kind of access to celebrities that twitter facebook and instagram afford today many felt lee didn t share enough credit with such comics pioneers as jack kirby and steve ditko who worked alongside him in those early years as he developed the marvel method of story development fair enough but part of lee s genius was his ability to be a master of collage like a bob dylan or a gene roddenberry lee took cultural threads elements already afoot in society and constructed his own quilt while his source material was sometimes derivative what he stitched was something new under the sun and within his emerging pantheon of white male angst lee was often an enthusiastic champion of progressive views about race if not always gender the now fabled black panther first appeared in a marvel comic book in becoming one of the earliest mainstream superheroes of african descent though it took until for him to snag a marquee spot in a comic entitled jungle action none of us is all that different from each other we all want essentially the same things outta life lee wrote in the pages of marvel comics in february so why don t we all stop wasting time hating the other guys just look in the mirror mister that other guy is you marvel is a calibrated commercial juggernaut now its stories drowning in the merchandise that amplifies them it has been dismissed as mass produced storytelling for a mass produced age yet somehow among the things lee manages to leave behind is a lingering sense snake oil maybe but potent nonetheless that with marvel s tales still anything might happen because as stan lee knew well before america did we still want our fantastic unlikely superheroes to be just like us or more saliently we want to believe that we can be just like them and who knows what they might do to prevail because after all who really knows what we might do maybe we can be heroes sure but the rent s still due on the th,neg

israelis palestinians brace for the worst as gaza ceasefire kicks in tel aviv israel as palestinian militants controlling the gaza strip exchanged fire with israeli soldiers in the most intense fighting for years tuesday the people below the soaring rockets braced for further bloodshed the flare up seemingly triggered by a botched israeli raid into gaza on sunday killed seven palestinians and one israeli before a ceasefire was announced by militant groups a truce would provide much needed respite for civilians either side of the fence between israel and the blockaded palestinian enclave mohammad al hatoum said he tried to distract his two young daughters from israeli airstrikes by playing cartoons on television with the volume turned up high it didn t help the bombing was so loud and my daughters didn t stop crying said al hatoum who is and lives with his family in western gaza the government employee not only heard the explosions he smelled and felt them i felt the entire building shaking he told nbc news describing the effect as like a magnitude earthquake violence is nothing new for civilians inside the crowded and desperately poor strip that has been run by hamas militants since nor is it new to those in israeli communities nearby israel has fought three wars in the enclave during the last decade and fears are growing that a new conflict is on the way children from nirim climb on a tank near the the gaza strip menahem kahana afp getty images file since monday hamas and other armed factions fired over rockets or mortars across the fenced border the most intense rocket fire on israel since the war the israeli military said this came after militants carried out a missile attack on a bus that wounded an israeli soldier this follows months of fires

visited the border community of netivot telling israeli citizens to take good care of themselves and to follow the order of the israel defense forces israel s ministerial committee on national security affairs issued a statement saying they had told the israeli military to continue its operations if necessary the recent fighting appeared to have been set off by a botched israeli special

climate change led to the demise of the ancient indus valley civilisation the mystery surrounding what killed off the ancient indus valley civilisation may finally have been solved scientists say that climate change led to the advanced people s demise by driving them out of their cities which were among the earliest ever built as seasonal rainfall dried up due to global warming the indus were forced into villages in the himalayan foothills years ago within the next millennium these isolated village groups died off as their water supply diminished researchers said they warned the find spells trouble for modern groups in the middle east and africa forced from their land by climate change scroll down for video pictured is an archaeological site in pakistan that was once a settlement built by the indus valley civilisation it s remarkable and there s a powerful lesson for today said study coauthor dr liviu giosan a researcher at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts if you look at syria and africa the migration out of those areas has some roots in climate change this is just the beginning sea level rise due to climate change can lead to huge migrations from low lying regions like bangladesh or from hurricane prone regions in the southern us back then the harappans could cope with change by moving but today you ll run into all sorts of borders political and social convulsions can then follow the indus civilisation also known as the harappans was an advanced bronze age society that thrived in the indus river valley of what is now modern pakistan along with ancient egypt and mesopotamia it was one of three early civilisations of the old world the indus valley civilisation possessed considerable skills when it came to town planning and building including toilets and baths pictured which were connected to a brick drainage system that ran along the streets among their settlements researchers have previously uncovered the world s first known toilets along with complex stone weights drilled gemstone necklaces and exquisitely carved seal stone the civilisation died out around years ago and researchers have spent decades trying to understand why researchers studied sediment samples taken from the ocean floor at several sites in the arabian sea off pakistan s coast what do we know about the indus valley civilisation the indus civilisation also known as the harappan civilisation was an advanced bronze age society it developed mainly in the northwestern regions of south asia from to years ago the indus cities were at their richest between and and bc along with ancient egypt and mesopotamia it was one of three early civilisations of the old world the indus occupied the indus river valley area in modern pakistan and india the empire stretched from the arabian sea to the ganges over what is now pakistan india and afghanistan at its peak the civilisation may have had a population of more than million making up per cent of the world s population among their settlements researchers have uncovered the world s first known toilets along with complex stone weights drilled gemstone necklaces and exquisitely carved seal stone etched in of these artefacts is an unusual and complex script which researchers are racing to decipher why the civilisation disappeared around years ago remains a msytery but experts have suggested war famine or even climate change could have been responsible advertisement they examined fragments of ancient dna found in the sediments to give them clues about what organisms thrived in the region during the summer and winter the seafloor near the mouth of the indus is a very low oxygen environment so whatever grows and dies in the water is very well preserved in the sediment dr giosan said you can basically get fragments of dna of nearly anything that s lived there their findings showed that winter monsoons in the area intensified around bc while summer monsoons dried up this was evident in the sediment dna as strong winds brought nutrients from the deeper ocean to the surface feeding a surge in plant and animal life what do we know about the indus cities the indus valley civilisation possessed considerable skills when it came to town planning and building the cities of harappa and mohenjo daro are laid out in grids with individual homes supplied with water from wells and waste water diverted to covered drains this is perhaps the world s first known sanitation system some houses had two storeys a bath and a courtyard the needs of citizens were catered for with municipal buildings marketplaces dockyards granaries warehouses and protective walls to shield inhabitants from floods and attack unlike in other early human civilisations no evidence of temples or palaces have been found yet evidence suggests the indus had a social hierarchy it s thought most city dwellers were traders or artisans with elaborate pottery beads and metalwork recovered advertisement likewise weaker winds other times of year provide fewer nutrients causing slightly less productivity in the waters offshore by bc the indus had abandoned their cities as agriculture in the huge urban areas became impossible moving to smaller villages in the himalayan foothills the rains in the foothills were enough to hold the rural harapans over for the next millennium but even those eventually dried up likely contributing to their demise we can t say that they disappeared entirely due to climate at the same time the indo aryan culture was arriving in the region with iron age tools and horses and carts dr giosan said but it s very likely that the winter monsoon played a role,neg
warmer winter temperatures related to higher crime rates milder winter weather increased regional crime rates in the united states over the past several decades according to new research that suggests crime is related to temperature s effect on daily activities a new study published in geohealth a journal of the american geophysical union finds u s crime rates are linked to warmer temperatures and this relationship follows a seasonal pattern the findings support the theory that three major ingredients come together to bring about crime a motivated offender a suitable target and the absence of a guardian to prevent a violation of the law during certain seasons namely winter milder weather conditions increase the likelihood these three elements come together and that violent and property crimes will take place according to the new study unexpectedly warmer summer temperatures were not linked with higher crime rates the new research abates existing theories that hot temperatures drive aggressive motivation and behavior according to the study s authors instead the new research suggests crime is related to the way climate alters people s daily activities we were expecting to find a more consistent relationship between temperature and crime but we weren t really expecting that relationship to be changing over the course of the year said ryan harp lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the university of colorado boulder that ended up being a pretty big revelation for us understanding how climate affects crime rates could expand the boundaries of what scientists would consider to be a climate and health connection harp said ultimately it s a health impact he said the relationship between climate human interaction and crime that we ve unveiled is something that will have an impact on people s wellbeing regional climate affects human interaction previous studies have found a link between temperature and the incidence of crime but none have looked at the relationship on a regional level and only some have controlled for underlying seasonal changes allowing researchers to identify the potential underlying mechanism in the new study harp and his co author conducted a systematic investigation into the relationship between large scale climate variability and regionally aggregated crime rates using a technique that allowed them to group together detailed spatial data on seasonal temperature and crime rates from across the united states they compared crime and climate data from the federal bureau of investigation s uniform crime reporting ucr program and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s north american regional reanalysis narr the data encompassed cities across five defined us regions northeast southeast south central west and midwest from to their finding that violent crime is almost always more prevalent when temperatures are warmer in the winter months was especially notable in areas with the strongest winters like the midwest and northeast according to the researchers the new findings showing that increasing temperatures matter more in the winter than in the summer is interesting said marshall burke assistant professor of earth system science at stanford university who was not involved with the new study the authors rightly suggest that this is more consistent with warmer temperatures altering people s patterns of activity like going outside more than a physiological story about temperature and aggression he said source https news agu org press release warmer winter temperatures linked to increased crime study finds,neg

youngest kids in class may be over diagnosed with adhd does being the youngest in the class up your child s odds of being erroneously diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd it might new research suggests these kids appear to be about percent more likely to receive a diagnosis of adhd however it probably doesn t change a child s actual risk of developing adhd so if your child was an august baby and your school district has a sept birth date cutoff for school admissions your child will be one of the youngest in class and particularly in the early grades those age gaps can make a big difference in behavior researchers said physicians should take into account a child s age relative to their peers behavior that is normal for a child s age may appear anomalous when compared to older peers explained study author timothy layton an assistant professor of health care policy at harvard medical school the consequences from not factoring in age might be overdiagnosis and overtreatment of the disorder according to layton he noted that kids born in august in areas with a september birthday cutoff were also more likely to be given medication for adhd symptoms adhd is a neurodevelopmental disorder that s common in children but it may not always last into adulthood according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention kids with adhd may have trouble controlling their behavior may act impulsively and may be overly active the cdc says adhd rates have been rising sharply among america s youth over the past two decades the rate of adhd jumped from percent to percent according to a recent study from the university of iowa in children between ages and the rate of adhd diagnosis went up by percent between and according to background information from the study in more than percent of u s children were being treated with medication for adhd there s no single test that can diagnose adhd the cdc says instead doctors must rely on a medical exam along with information from parents teachers and sometimes the child doctors have to rule out other disorders that can cause symptoms similar to adhd to see how a child s birth date might affect the risk of being diagnosed with adhd the researchers reviewed data from a large insurance database with information on more than youngsters from states the kids were born between and and followed through in states that had a sept cutoff date for starting kindergarten the researchers found that out of august born youngsters were diagnosed with adhd for those born in september the adhd rate was per kids when the researchers looked at treatment for adhd they found that out of children born in august were getting adhd medication compared to out of kids born in september layton said these findings would likely hold true in districts that had other cutoff dates for starting school for example in a school with a dec birthday cutoff for school entry kids born in november would probably be more likely to receive an adhd diagnosis than kids born in december dr andrew adesman chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at cohen children s medical center in new hyde park n y said this nicely designed study has confirmed what several other investigators have likewise demonstrated that the youngest children within a grade are more likely to be diagnosed with adhd than are the oldest children in that same grade adesman who was not part of the study said that if the researchers looked at kids closer in age in the same grade say just a few months apart the differences would likely be smaller he said this study suggests that parents of kids who are young for their grade who have adhd symptoms may want to consider having their child repeat a grade this might give a child time to mature so he or she will behave more appropriately in school the findings were published nov in the new england journal of medicine,neg

google s parent has a plan to eliminate mosquitoes worldwide bloomberg silicon valley researchers are attacking flying bloodsuckers in california s fresno county it s the first salvo in an unlikely war for google parent alphabet inc eradicating mosquito borne diseases around the world a white high top mercedes van winds its way through the suburban sprawl and strip malls as a swarm of male aedes aegypti mosquitoes shoot out of a black plastic tube on the passenger side window these pests are tiny and with a wingspan of just a few millimeters all but invisible you hear that little beating sound says kathleen parkes a spokesperson for verily life sciences a unit of alphabet she s trailing the van in her car the windows down like a duh duh duh that s the release of the mosquitoes jacob crawford a verily senior scientist riding with parkes begins describing a mosquito control technique with dazzling potential these particular vermin he explains were bred in the ultra high tech surroundings of verily s automated mosquito rearing system miles away in south san francisco they were infected with wolbachia a common bacterium when those lab bred wolbachia infected male mosquitoes mate with their counterpart females in the wild the result is stealth annihilation the offspring never hatch better make that one just hit the windshield says crawford mosquito borne disease eradication is serious stuff for alphabet though it is just one of many of the company s forays into health care and life sciences through verily and other branches of the company alphabet is investigating smart contact lenses artificial intelligence applications for health care and the molecular mechanisms of aging just this month google hired geisinger health chief executive officer david feinberg to oversee its many health care initiatives verily guards its technology closely but it stands to reason that if it succeeds in making mosquito control easy and cheap enough it could have a lucrative offering on its hands many governments and businesses around the globe might be glad to pay for a solution to their mosquito problems story continues in the arid climate of california s central valley a aegypti are detested for their vicious bite but there at least they don t typically transmit disease other places aren t so lucky the mosquito species is among the world s deadliest spreading diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya in the tropics and subtropics the diseases its bite carries kill tens of thousands of people every year and infect millions more releasing wolbachia infected mosquitoes into the wild may eventually wipe out entire populations of deadly mosquitoes and the diseases they carry at least that s the plan if the field tests pan out in california every morning during mosquito season which runs from april to november the van emblazoned with debug fresno cruises through leafy housing tracks full of multistory homes at predetermined locations an algorithm automatically releases carefully calculated numbers of mosquitoes counting each individual insect with the help of a laser as it exits the van as the efforts to wipe out mosquito borne diseases have ramped up a few different approaches to the problem have emerged bill gates alone has pledged more than billion for technologies that may help wipe out malaria including controversial efforts to genetically modify mosquitoes verily s approach relies on a variation of a very old strategy known as sterile insect technique in which a population is gradually killed off by interfering with the ability to reproduce it s unclear what would happen if the world s disease causing mosquitoes were done away with the ecological role that mosquitoes play hasn t been thoroughly studied though some scientists suggest we might be just fine without them but it s clear that a aegypti has no business in fresno county native to warmer wetter climes no one knows where they came from when they first showed up in all that s certain is that they have spread extremely rapidly after we detected it we did a massive and extensive effort to prevent the mosquito from establishing and eliminate it says jodi holeman the scientific services director for fresno county s consolidated mosquito abatement district we were not successful in any way shape or form the county went from having not much of a mosquito problem at all to having one that made residents avoid their backyards and porches unlike most mosquitoes a aegypti lives and breeds in places inhabited by people laying its eggs in say the few droplets of stagnant water at the bottom of a wine glass left on a balcony then hiding under beds and in closets biting legs and ankles this makes it much harder to fight going door to door and begging residents to dump out standing water wasn t cutting it so in fresno teamed up with a scientist named stephen dobson and his company mosquitomate it was dobson s lab that figured out how to infect mosquitoes with a form of wolbachia that s different from the type of the bacteria that mosquitoes usually carry that s what makes the eggs unviable mosquitomate makes two species of mosquitoes infected with wolbachia a aegypti and aedes albopictus fresno became one of its test sites the initial fresno trials were the first time male a aegypti infected with the bacteria had ever been released in the u s the next year verily stepped in to help scale those efforts up bringing more advanced technologies to the breeding and release process that would they hoped eventually make fighting mosquitoes massively scalable it seems to be working this year verily signed on for a second season of releases two verily trucks ply four different neighborhoods hitting more than homes over six months the company released more than million mosquitoes results from suggested the population of biting female mosquitoes dropped by two thirds this year tweaks to the program have cut the mosquito population by a whopping percent a second project by verily in innisfail australia that concluded in june reduced the mosquito population by percent this bodes well for eventually bringing the technology to other parts of the world regions ravaged not just by itchy ankles but by deadly disease at first verily executives were worried about community resistance to fighting bugs with more bugs so the company set up an outreach booth complete with a cage full of male mosquitoes that people could stick their hands in to learn that males don t bite only female mosquitoes bite which is why this and similar projects are careful to only release males we really appreciate you being here clifford lopes a resident told the company i brag to people about how i can sit on my porch now and not get bit in videos of the original trials you can see holeman the fresno county scientist gingerly blowing the mosquitoes out of a tube the release van is now filled with proprietary technology including software that determines exactly what areas of a neighborhood mosquitoes should be released in and a laser sensitive enough to count every single one as it exits generating loads of data that can later be used to fine tune the process at verily s headquarters the factory where the mosquitoes are bred incorporates even more automation once the eggs are laid robots rear the mosquitoes to adulthood packaging them in containers filled with water and air feeding them and keeping them warm still other robots sort them by sex first by size females are bigger and then optically using proprietary technology mosquitoes are all given a digital identifier that makes it possible to follow them from egg state to the specific gps coordinate where they re released with this year s season wrapping up the company has yet to decide whether it will further expand the program next year verily wouldn t say how much it costs to manufacture and release tens of thousands of mosquitoes every day but it s a safe bet that it s still an expensive proposition the key part is trying to be able to do a program like this in a very affordable and efficient way

indonesia aviation in spotlight after lion air crash jakarta bumpy runways hair raising safety lapses remote airstrips with no navigation systems and a dire shortage of experienced captains and maintenance crews indonesia is one of the world s fastest growing aviation markets but it has come under fresh scrutiny since a fatal lion air crash last month as the sector struggles to keep up with its breakneck expansion putting safety at risk analysts warn advertisement advertisement the vast increase in demand and operations has seen more regular accidents or events taking place that are preventable said stephen wright an aviation expert at the university of leeds on wednesday investigators issued a preliminary report that said the doomed lion air jet had technical problems that the airline failed to fix before its final flight all people on board were killed as the nearly new boeing slammed into the sea shortly after takeoff while officials did not lay blame or pinpoint a definitive cause of the oct accident they said the budget carrier must take steps to improve its safety culture advertisement advertisement despite a spotty safety record and an avalanche of complaints over shoddy service the carrier s parent lion air group which also operates five other airlines has captured half the domestic market in less than years of operation the group now has southeast asia s biggest fleet more than planes with growth driven by a model built on cheap prices and flights to almost every corner of the vast indonesian archipelago advertisement worst in the world indonesia s safety record has improved analysts say since its airlines including national carrier garuda were banned for years from us and european airspace for safety violations still the country has recorded fatal aviation accidents over the past years the us and eu flight bans have been lifted in recent years but the industry is still wrestling with outdated infrastructure accusations of cutting corners and heavy restrictions on hiring pilots and technicians from overseas to plug staff gaps if you want to grow quickly you have to hire foreigners but here we have regulations which prevent us from easily hiring them said jakarta based aviation analyst gerry soejatman lion air which captured headlines in with a then record us billion order for boeing planes sits at the centre of a us billion plus sector with double digit annual growth and million domestic travellers last year alone the carrier s chief edward sirait acknowledged that people may see lion as a tacky company that hires grumpy service staff straight out of high school but he disputed any suggestion that pilots including those that fly on international routes are not properly trained they d never be able to fly abroad if they weren t qualified he told afp indonesia s transport ministry said it is pushing lion and other airlines for safety and service improvements some indonesian lawmakers however want the budget carrier s licence to be revoked a call that may be bolstered by wednesday s report such punishment is unlikely given the size of the lion air group a major employer that has ballooned as indonesia s growing economy and rising incomes have given more of its million people access to air travel its co founder rusdi kirana who described his own airline as the worst in the world in a interview is a close confidante of president joko widodo who appointed him to the key post of indonesia s ambassador to neighbouring malaysia and the firm s growth strategy is crucial to widodo s infrastructure push which includes plans for dozens of new airports including a us billion hub in the capital as he seeks re election next year lion air is also the only carrier to service many remote parts of a island country where some of the more than airports don t even have proper navigation equipment that means pilots have been forced to use their sight alone while landing over perilous terrain and on less than smooth runways there are still many runways with uneven surfaces so when the plane lands its feels like you re driving on a potholed road said lion air captain yusni maryan no clue as a frequent flyer indonesian civil servant amalia pissano has her share of horror stories from the lion air captain who delayed a flight for two hours so he could have a meal to a terrifying experience aboard a sriwijaya air flight on the same route as the crashed lion jet the plane suddenly began shaking violently before it plunged toward the ground sparking chaos inside the cabin until pilots regained control and landed safely she said the crew never offered an explanation pissano said it was really scary because the plane was rocking and the crew seemed to have no clue what was happening,neg

earliest uk estimates of children affected in the womb by alcohol intake during pregnancy a report published on november in preventive medicine reveals that a stunning percent of children could possibly be affected by alcohol exposure during their intrauterine life this refers to a group of lifelong conditions caused by prenatal drinking called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder fasd hteam shutterstock drinking during pregnancy is extremely common in the uk which ranks fourth in the world in this respect however there are no population based studies to provide an approximation of the number of people with fasd fasd is often classified as a relatively invisible and underdiagnosed disability due to the lack of overt physical symptoms and signs there is only one clinic that deals with this specialty directly in england to address this need a team from the university of bristol and cardiff university used a screening tool to gather a wide range of information on maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy in collaboration with medical professionals the research covered children whose development had been followed in the bristol s children of the s study the results were astonishing showing alcohol exposure in up to percent of children in the study while a positive screen was obtained for fasd symptoms in up to percent the screen was defined to be positive if the child had problems with learning or behavior in at least three different areas either with or without physical features such as growth deficiency and a distinctive facies marked by a smooth philtrum a thin upper lip and small eye openings while the positive screening results for fasd were rightly distinguished from a diagnosis of the condition the study outcome was disturbing in terms of the very high rate of drinking in pregnancy and the high prevalence of symptoms suggestive of fasd that it showed this may indicate that fasd is probably a significant public health burden in the uk the ability to arrive at an approximate fasd prevalence is important since without such information few people are likely to be aware of the condition this would result in the condition going undiagnosed or being diagnosed late in children adolescents and adults as a result they would be deprived of necessary support the researchers point out that the information they used is several years old meanwhile the current medical opinion on the safety of drinking during pregnancy has officially changed however the rates of fetal alcohol exposure within the uk are still high with recent information suggesting that percent of women do drink while they are pregnant a third of these women binge on alcohol this could indicate that many people are currently experiencing fasd symptoms the most up to date guidance states that the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all if you are pregnant or if you think you may become pregnant it is important that people are aware of the risks so that they can make an informed decision about drinking in pregnancy dr cheryl mcquire the leader of the study who is a researcher in epidemiology and alcohol related outcomes at the university of bristol moreover she says the study points to the need for future research to clearly identify how many people in the uk have fasd today countries such as canada the us and italy have made use of in school screening measures to arrive at a prevalence of up to percent among children going up to a disturbing percent when it comes to children who are being given care another researcher dr raja mukherjee who heads an fasd diagnostic clinic at surrey and boarders partnership nhs foundation trust pointed out that the current study shows an apparent mismatch between the findings and the rarity of the condition as reported by most clinicians the research reveals that many people suffering with this condition are probably going undiagnosed in the general population it shows that it is a disorder that is seemingly hidden in plain sight that we need to pay attention to unless we start looking for it we will continue to miss it if we fail to diagnose it then those affected individuals will continue to be affected by a lack of support these results can be the first step in helping us in the uk to realise it is no longer a condition we can ignore dr mukherjee sandra butcher chief executive of the no fas uk underlined the wide scope of the screening saying that it shines light on a staggeringly widespread and largely avoidable public health crisis she states that the only way to go from here for anyone in a position to influence or make public health policy and who cares about protecting those in society who are at most risk both mentally and physically is to put in place a complete training and action program which covers the prevention diagnosis and support of fasd such support will be required lifelong because fasd is an incurable condition and requires increasing levels of support as affected children grow into adulthood and beyond the most current medical advice on drinking in pregnancy from the chief medical officer in january states that for women who are pregnant or think they could become pregnant it is safest to abstain from all alcohol to minimize the risk of fetal alcohol exposure however if small amounts of alcohol were ingested before pregnancy was detected or even during pregnancy the risk of any toxicity is low according to the guideline according to this advice if a pregnant woman has drunk alcohol before knowing that she was pregnant further drinking is to be avoided it is safe to say that the baby will not be affected in the majority of these cases the guideline goes on to suggest talking to a healthcare provider if a woman is concerned about using alcohol in pregnancy,neg
aids treatment has progressed but without a vaccine suffering still abounds i mentioned to a friend a gay man nearing that world aids day which has been observed on dec since was almost upon us he had no idea that world aids day still exists this lack of knowledge is a testament to the great accomplishments that have occurred since world aids day was created years ago it is also due to an accident in the timing of his birth that my friend escaped the devastation wreaked by aids among gay men in the u s before there was antiretroviral therapy many people have forgotten aids but there are consequences to forgetting the fight against aids is at a tipping point increasingly there are signs that we may be heading in the wrong direction many successes yet the grand prize is elusive i am a social epidemiologist with more than years of research experience in hiv and std prevention i am also the founder of the basics with dr mo a sex health communications project that translates prevention science directly for people who need it most it is true that global hiv aids success stories abound mother to child transmission can be reduced to below percent percent of people living with hiv know their status and percent receive antiretroviral therapy most recently pre exposure prophylaxis prep the use of antiretrovial drugs to prevent hiv infection among those exposed has proved to be a successful prevention approach yet the prize a vaccine that can prevent hiv infection remains elusive and makes impossible the use of the only known strategy to have ever eradicated an infectious disease widespread vaccination that disease was smallpox in the seeds of unease despite the lack of a vaccine in united nations member states adopted a political declaration on ending the aids epidemic by as part of the accountability framework interim goals set a target of new hiv infections for that year a review of the most recent data estimated million new hiv infections in exactly the same number as in prominent scientists have already begun to question the ability to eradicate aids by the deadline and concede that the situation has stagnated the attainment of eradication looks bleak without the aid of either an effective vaccine or the immediate large scale promotion and utilization of existing prevention tools i e condoms voluntary circumcision and potentially prep given that the vast majority of new hiv infections are sexually transmitted and that condoms have played a decisive role in the global control of hiv transmission ongoing condom availability and use will be essential to future eradication condoms both male and female remain a highly effective mechanism of hiv aids prevention as well as of other sexually transmitted infections that greatly enhance the risk of hiv transmission condom use is also strongly advised by global public health institutions including the world health organization and the u s centers for disease control and prevention in conjunction will all other hiv prevention tools including prep because of their lower levels of effectiveness in preventing transmission condom availability is a different matter and varies greatly from country to country countries with the highest levels of hiv often rely heavily on donor support according to the most recent data in sub saharan africa in only condoms were available annually for every man aged to as compared with the recommended to and on average there was one female condom available for every eight women funding required to maintain let alone scale up hiv commitments particularly those dedicated to prevention are increasingly uncertain the hydra sprouting new heads even though condoms are an extremely effective barrier method it is usage that makes condoms efficacious in preventing hiv transmission reported condom use varies considerably around the world and ranges from percent use by men in namibia and cambodia to less than percent usage by men and women in other countries including some highly affected by hiv such as sierra leone and mozambique age plays a role too among young people aged to condom use at last sex varies from more than percent in some latin american and european countries to less than percent in some west african countries in the u s condom use is at the lower end of the spectrum only one third of the population uses condoms a number that has not changed significantly over the past two decades the majority percent of the world s hiv aids cases are in sub saharan africa where there has been much progress particularly with the provision of antiretroviral therapy however there are worrying signs in other parts of the world there has been little change in new hiv infections in countries outside of sub saharan africa between and in fact six of the most populous countries in the world have experienced percent to percent increases in new hiv infections since russia china brazil pakistan mexico and bangladesh even in countries such as the u s where new hiv infections have decreased by percent overall the rates of change are unevenly distributed for example young african american men who have sex with men show no decrease in new infections african american gay and bisexual men represent the largest percentage of new hiv infections more than one quarter the increased provision of antiretroviral therapy to people living with aids has had a huge impact on extending life and in preventing new hiv infections however there remains percent of the population who live with hiv about million people who do not know their status while we have been necessarily focused on the head of the hydra in sub saharan africa other hydra heads are beginning to make their presence known many in countries ill prepared to deal with increases in the number of new hiv infections in the absence of a vaccine behavior change in the form of condom use promotion acceptance and adoption at a scale that many gay men utilized during the peak of the aids epidemic in the industrialized world will need to occur there are many challenges continued stigma and gender inequality not to mention issues of availability distribution and proactive nonjudgmental promotion we must not forget progress on reducing the rate of new hiv infection has been done before it can be done again but only if we take forceful funded action now,neg

four in ten australians think women lie about being victims of sexual assault four in ten australians think sexual assault accusations are a way of getting back at men according to the fourth national community attitudes survey ncas on violence against women released today almost the same proportion believe women make up claims of abuse when going through child custody battles in court yet research shows false allegations are rare in fact sexual assault harassment and domestic violence are under reported to police violence against women is common with two out of every five australian women experiencing some form of physical or sexual violence since the age of and much of it from a male partner or ex partner ncas is a federally funded survey conducted by the independent research organisation anrows in it involved phone interviews with a representative sample of australians aged years and older it s the third such national survey allowing us to compare responses with those in and read more rape culture why our community attitudes to sexual violence matter it s not all bad news the results show a majority of australians understand that physical assault emotional abuse and controlling behaviour are forms of violence against women and are common in our community consistent investment in programs and campaigns has had a positive impact on reducing attitudes that support violence such as minimising and excusing out of a score of the average score has reduced from in to in anrows blaming the victim the survey found one in three australians believe women are partly responsible for relationship violence if they do not leave a violent partner another third believe if a woman sends a nude image to her partner she is partly responsible if he shares it without her permission when questions are asked about the role of alcohol in relation to violence attribute responsibility and blame to women who were raped while alcohol or drug affected some of australians absolve men of blame if they are alcohol or drug affected at the time they perpetrate rape two out of ten australians believe because women express themselves sexually in public it s not surprising men think they can touch them without permission read more be careful posting images online is just another form of modern day victim blaming when victim blaming attitudes are held by a substantial proportion of people or influential people such as police judges and health professionals they can present barriers to victims seeking support or reporting the abuse such attitudes also shift responsibility away from the perpetrators of violence contributing to a culture in which perpetrator behaviour is at best not clearly condemned or at worst is actively condoned disregard for consent one in ten australians believe if a woman is drunk and starts having sex with a man but then falls asleep it is understandable if he continues to have sex with her the survey also asked australians to respond to a scenario where a woman takes her husband into the bedroom starts kissing him then pushes him away not wanting to continue with sex more than one in ten believed her husband would have been justified in having sex with her anyway disregarding consent for touching women sending nude photos or persisting with sex when a woman does not or cannot give consent are criminal offences in australia these findings are significant because they indicate a concerning proportion of australians are unclear about what constitutes consent and the line between consensual sex and coercion mistrusting women s reports as well as thinking women make up claims of abuse one quarter of australians believe women exaggerate the problem of male violence almost a third believe that a lot of times women who say they were raped had led the man on and then had regrets attitudes that suggest women lie to get back at men are particularly concerning in light of the high levels of violence against women as well as under reporting of these crimes the fear of not being believed or taken seriously presents a barrier for women seeking help and support read more australians still trivialise and excuse violence against women attitudes are a barometer of socially acceptable behaviour and changing attitudes is often the first step toward changing behaviour attitudes can mean a perpetrator being held to account instead of his behaviour being ignored or a bystander taking action rather than turning a blind eye and now for the good news one of the pillars of the national plan to reduce violence against women and their children has been to support attitude change as a first step to reducing prevalence of violence against women the ncas survey shows there has been an increase in the understanding of violence against women moving from an average score of to and improvement in support for gender equality moving from an average score of to anrows anrows exploring the detail of the survey questions shows an improvement on of the individual questions asked in both and while there are specific areas of concern australians knowledge of and attitudes towards violence against women and gender equality are gradually improving most australians do not endorse this violence australian governments have invested heavily in campaigns and programs to reduce men s violence against women over the past ten years and the current ncas results show that there have been some rewards changing attitudes and improving knowledge takes time as well as continued policy and program efforts it s vital that governments organisations and communities across australia keep up the momentum if we are to ultimately see the end of attitudes that allow violence against women to occur http ncas anrows

africa children and hiv aids we need to talk about men s power over girls interview johannesburg adolescents are projected to die of aids related diseases between and this means adolescent deaths every day without additional investment in hiv prevention testing and treatment programmes unicef has said in a new report titled children hiv and aids the world in allafrica s sethi ncube spoke with dr shaffiq essajee deputy chief of hiv programming at unicef global essajee is also a member of the paediatric infectious disease faculty at new york university where he has been caring for children who are hiv for the past years dr essajee was born in kenya and in he established one of the first free paediatric hiv clinics in the country in the city of mombasa statistics show that hiv is prevalent among adolescents few schools in africa have aids awareness programmes what is the unicef doing to make sure awareness is thought of as early as possible i think that we have to recognise that what you understand and know about hiv about sex and sexuality must be appropriate to your development and maturity you can t take a six year old and say now let s talk about hiv prevention what you can say to him or her is that your body is yours and you must not let somebody touch it without your permission you mustn t let somebody give you ouchies if you don t want that so there are age appropriate things that you can do which you build upon gradually so that children can get that awareness and i think we think of it as something that s negative a naughty thing how are we going to talk about sex we shouldn t be talking about those sorts of things but the whole notion of comprehensive sexuality education says that s not a useful way of thinking yes it has to be age appropriate but it can happen at a very young age where you can start to introduce some ideas some concepts that you ll gradually layer information on unicef doesn t do this on its own we work very closely with some agencies like unesco which has produced a global way of thinking on sexuality education there s a lot of materials curricular that can actually be used by adapted by countries to their local context unicef promotes that process so that we promote the idea that countries will take a look at this information and see how to incorporate it into their school curriculum we should be teaching this in school doing it in way that are age appropriate that are sensitive to the local culture and context but doing it because it s important to protect young people to empower them to give them urgency and to protect them from violence and harm for some reason when it comes to sex education we shy away from talking about sex because we imagine that it will encourage sexuality the reality is the opposite actually most studies that have been done show that the more you educate children about these issues about what s healthy sexuality and what maybe isn t the better informed kids get and the more likely that they are to delay sexual debut the more likely they are to use protection when they become sexually active the less likely they are to acquire hiv or other stis or become pregnant as teenagers so giving children awareness and information is critical to their long term health and wellbeing what do you think needs to be done to tackle the stigma that comes with young people trying to access hiv health care trying to access condoms and information that s a real tough one because stigma is in all of us stigma exists in every health professional i can not say that i m indeed free from this whether its a fleeting thought that goes through my mind negative ideas exist in all of us all of us have biases prejudices but as professionals what we have to remember is that we got to have to leave all of that sh t at home you can not bring it into the work place in the work place your job is to be the servant of humanity if that s what you ve signed up for then that what you need to do i think unicef spends a lot of time doing stigma reduction amongst health professionals because that s the point where it hurts the most i think that stigma education and reduction actually is critically important first and foremost in the health service we are not recognising that people need a little bit love attention nurturing even as much as they need these arvs that s a message that needs to come out much much strongly and ironically in the days before we had access to drugs and all we had was love and nurturing and a kind ear we recognised that and we were better at it we ve over medicalised hiv instead of recognising it as a human problem and we have to change that with so many conflicts around the world in africa particularly that often shifts hiv fighting efforts to the background in favour of humanitarian aid how do we make sure testing is done knowing that early detection is key and how do you bring about awareness in such environments knowing that hiv aids is not top of priorities in such situations first of all it should be a priority because in fact we know that hiv spreads precisely in those situations those situations expose women to violence people take to violence in ways that they might not be exposed to in a healthy society that s functioning you disrupt that society you put people on the move you put them in displaced people s camps and you disturb the normal order of society and the conventions that protect people from getting hiv so unicef has recognised this for a long time and recognised that even in the programming that we do in emergencies whether it s civil strife war refugees caused by drought or some other natural disaster that putting people into camps and into environments where there are no more protection mechanisms no longer function increases the risk of hiv so we have a concerted programme to ensure that in such refugee settings hiv is not a forgotten element and again it s because what you do to protect people from hiv also protects them from harm in general it s about protecting them from gender based violence it s about protecting them from coercive sex which brings untold harms which in addition to the possibility of hiv transmission and so we work in environmental situations to ensure that we are building that bridge between the humanitarian response and the broader development response in the country today we are discussing such worrying statistics that concern children and adolescents why are we speaking in their absence and this looks like a small event should we not be making lot of noise about this huge issue first of all you are right of course we have some young people at this world aids event we can and should always do more to make sure that young people are involved not just in our thinking but also in our programming for me especially it s because i m a doctor i m familiar with the things that i know i m good at drugs and i m good at medicine what i don t understand because i am a man in my fifties is really what it s like for a young person a young woman living in the society how can i really get an understanding of what her experience is like in such a way that i can provide advice on what should be done to change her experience and so without making sure young people are actually driving this thinking and driving the implementation of programmings surely we won t have the success that we want to achieve unicef in general recognises the importance of that and in this forum we tried with saidy brown to be there but we didn t succeed in having the full compliment of youth that we wanted to and should have done this is one media launch in one country we have similar things going on globally and of course in new york and also in other parts of the world so it is not an isolated event we are not the only voice unaids has put out a number of media documents that talk about the importance of knowing your status that is the theme they are pushing for world aids day the u s government has also put out strong messages on world aids day there are many voices not just unicef s and there are many events like this happening in other parts of the world that will hopefully amplify the message shouldn t more be done legally considering the huge numbers of new infections among adolescents who s having sexual intercourse with minors shouldn t there be an arm in unicef dealing with this problem i think child protection is a very important aspect of this so unicef legislates very strongly against practices that put children in harm s way like for example child marriage which is often a way that in some societies young girls are pushed into very early sexual debuts but sometimes it isn t the adults in the community that are putting those children at risk it is the fact that those children are living in such poverty themselves that suddenly they have something that is a commodity that someone is interested in and is interested in providing something like money some luxuries to that young person in exchange for their body that s a very damaging way of thinking for young people adolescence is a time of transition and a time of change sometimes things that happen in adolescence create life long changes in that individual s life so you can go through a phase where you need money and you think a sugar daddy is going to help me out with this it doesn t need to be forever this is just until i get a job i know he has a wife somewhere and i know he s got a family but what do i care it s going to be for a little while and then i ll make it on my own but if you end up with hiv or end up getting pregnant the effect of that is with you for life even if the situation was a short term situation that you needed to address in some way the consequences can stay forever and i think that s the kind of message that we need to get out there that young women and young girls don t put themselves in harm s way i think unicef needs to be more proactive about saying what about the guys why aren t we recognising that it is their desires they may not know that they have hiv but they definitely know that they are not going to marry these young girls they are not going to take them out of their poverty forever they just want to use them for their amusement and entertainment and it s a power struggle it s a power imbalance that is driving their behaviour so we have to recognise that imbalance of power that exists i m not saying it s a universal thing that we need to speak out against but what i m saying is that men need to recognise their behaviours and how they can be coercive and abusive and at the very least they need to be accessing services so that they know if they are living with hiv so that they do not pass it on to these unsuspecting young women that s the dialogue shift that needs to happen unicef of course is a child focused agency so tend to talk about the adolescent about the child but what i think what we need to do is mobilise better even though it s not our job to talk about men older men in society i think we need to mobilise in a different way to make sure that somebody is addressing that side of the equation as well what we are promoting globally now is really a push to say look at the multiples things that need to happen it s not just about pushing condoms out or making flavoured condoms available that may be helpful but in itself it definitely won t be yes put out your flavoured condoms but make it part of a package make sure girls stay in school make sure education and information is available to young people make sure services aren t stigmatising so that if a young person goes into a facility and asks about their options for hiv prevention somebody isn t going to chase them away there needs to be a shift in the way in which we are thinking and programming so that we take this multipronged approach to prevention close sign up

that they were on the drugs have improved so much since we started fighting this epidemic in the early years we used to use a drug called stavudine d t and this medication was really important because it was one of the first drugs it was cheap which meant that it was something that countries could afford to use and it meant that countries could start talking about large scale treatment programmes for a treatment at the time in the western world cost thousand and thousands of dollars a year so it was critical to have some of those early drugs to change people s mindsets and say wow it s possible to treat the millions of people living with hiv that live in poor countries as well as people that live in wealthy countries but at the same time those drugs were not necessarily the best options for long term treatment for people living with hiv we didn t know this at the time but now we know that a drug like stavudine causes some irreversible changes in the way in which the fat is distributed in the body and toxicities unfortunately don t go away even if you stop taking the drug you may not see a resolution of those kinds of changes that have taken place and so there are many people living with hiv who have been on treatment for a decade or more who were once started in with some of those early drugs who had an appearance that clearly showed that they had had some side effects from these therapies today the story is very different now we have drugs that are extremely well tolerated actually they are even cheaper than they used to be and they don t cause the sorts of disfiguring side effects that we used to see once upon a time we are on the cusp of a new drug that is being released and being used in countries called dolutegravir this new drug is now approved by who and unicef supports its roll out across the world and its extremely effective its very well tolerated its a very small pill so it can be easily combined with other treatments and its very affordable as well so really the evolution in the science of developing new treatments is on going one day we hope to have treatments that can be given once a month or once every three months by injection for example so that you don t have to take a pill everyday or many times a day you can get one injection every three months and that injection is good enough to keep your body suppressed with the hiv virus suppressed inside it until its time for your next injection science is always evolving fortunately in the world of hiv we have very good relationships with the industry that is developing these new drugs and we see continuous change in the kinds of options available,neg

semitism is alive and well across europe this was the glaring conclusion of a cnn investigation based in part on a survey of more than adults across seven european countries despite europe s troubling history with anti semitism ugly old stereotypes persist across the continent more than a quarter of europeans surveyed believe jews have too much influence in business and finance one in five say they have too much influence in media and politics in individual countries the numbers are often higher of hungarians think jews have too much influence in finance and business across the world while of europeans agree that anti semitism is a growing problem a substantial minority is unsympathetic to the problem almost one in five agree that most anti semitism in their country is a response to the everyday behavior of jewish people in poland of people think that jews use the holocaust to advance their position of hungarians admit to having an unfavorable impression of jews altogether so why is anti semitism a growing phenomenon once again poland s chief rabbi brooklyn born michael schudrich is not sure the problem ever really went away there will always be people who had anti semitic feelings and i don t know if the number has grown but this new situation today is they feel that it s more acceptable socially that they can express these opinions out loud the feeling beforehand was this is what i believe but don t tell anyone it was not perfect but at least there was a social taboo against anti semitism cnn saw this at first hand in germany a country still haunted by the killing of some six million jews at the hands of the nazis during the holocaust making anti semitic comments can be punishable under german law and yet at a rally of hundreds of right wing extremists in the nation s capital berlin we saw a man brazenly flash a nazi salute an act that could have landed him up to three years in jail another protester told us that a shadowy cabal of jewish globalists runs the world the arrival of some million refugees in germany has energized the far right the focus of their anger may be muslim migrants but they are reflexively anti semitic in their views the alternative for germany afd party once considered a fringe element now holds a solid seats in parliament its message is clear you don t have to be ashamed of being angry you don t have to be ashamed of being white you don t have to be ashamed of your past but the rise of the far right is only part of the picture based on dozens of interviews with members of various jewish communities across europe it is clear that the threat is being felt from many sides in france many jews talk about the new anti semitism coming from radical elements of france s growing muslim population which can be felt on the streets of paris working class suburbs a happy life is a hidden life we were told again and again by french jews who refused to appear on camera more and more jewish families are moving out of these traditionally mixed neighborhoods a concern for the french government which believes that integration not separation is key to improving the situation in germany the leader of berlin s kahal adass jisroel community organization doron rubin told me there is also concern about anti semitism coming from muslim refugees who have a different history and a different background especially obviously coming from the middle east and who have also because of israel a different attitude towards jews the nexus between negative attitudes toward israel and anti semitism is a particularly thorny issue more than a quarter of french people have a somewhat or significantly unfavorable impression of jews as a result of the israeli palestinian issue this impression is by no means limited to muslims across the continent many jews we interviewed spoke of anti semitism coming from the left which is often strongly critical of israel viewed as whole it is a complex picture made up of a confluence of different factors with no obvious one size fits all solution felix klein has called the results of the cnn poll into anti semitism appalling germany has appointed an anti semitsm czar felix klein who is working on creating a nationwide network for reporting anti semitsm and on improving education and integration in schools elsewhere france is spending millions of dollars trying to combat anti semitic hate speech online many agree that holocaust education is an important step half of europeans say that commemorating the holocaust helps to combat anti semitism and yet frighteningly the memory of the holocaust is starting to fade more than a third of europeans have either never heard of or know just a little about the holocaust that number is even higher when you look at the younger generation in france of young adults have never even heard of the holocaust when i asked rabbi schudrich how he feels about these numbers he paused a moment before responding it makes me feel i have more work to do europe should pay attention,neg
